# Readings from Jon Shaw

[Review and timeline][1] of Amazonian geologic and biotic diversification history.

[Norm Wickett et al's massive phylogenomic analysis][2] of algae and landplants. Mosses and liverworts are probably monophyletic but it isn't clear if they are:
  * sister to vascular plants with hornworts sister to all that -  h,((m,l),v), or
  * sister to hornworts and vascular plants - (m,l),(h,v), or
  * monophyletic with hornworts and all that is sister to vascular plants - ((m,l),h),v

The previously accepted order of bryophytes as successive sister groups to landplants wasn't well supported in this study - l,(m,(h,v))

[_Sphagnum palustre_ morphological diversity in the Azores][3] using microsats. There is more morphological diversity in the Azores than in mainland European and American populations (3 color morphs), but the diversity doesn't seem to have a genetic basis and individuals of different morphs on the same island are more genetically similar than individuals of the same morph on different islands, suggesting high levels of plasticity in island populations. It isn't clear if this is because there is higher environmental variability on islands compared to mainland or that colonizers of variable and stressful islands are selected for high plasticity.

[Sphagnum organellar phylogeny][4] using all mitochondrial and chloroplast genes. Five subgenera: (Rigida, (Subsegunda, Cuspidata), (Sphagnum, Acutifolia)). Several allopolyploid hybrids including some inter-subgeneric hybrids and one apparent haploid hybrid.

Cuspidata and Subsecunda tend to be species of hollows, whereas Sphagnum and Acutifolia tend to form hummocks. Rigida is less common in peatlands and the outgroups (Eosphagnum and Flatbergia don't occur in peatlands.
