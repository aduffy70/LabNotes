From research ideas discussion with Jon Shaw and Blanka Aguero. Three projects:

# 1) Mariana microsat data

Mariana left behind two mostly-analyzed microsat datasets of eastern NA Sphagnum in the "S. subsecundum complex" that need to be re-analyzed, written up and published. Rerun structure, look at IBD (with distinct groups there will be but it probably won't be linear--look at IBD within the groups?). Other biogeographic analyses?

## Diploid S. lescurii:
  * Exists as haploids and allodiploids. Diploids are result from hybridization with S. subsecundum (found in Europe/NA).
  * Range: New Jersey to Newfoundland
  * Structure suggests Newfoundland form a separate genetic group

## Diploid S. carolinianum:
  * Unknown second parent
  * Range: Mississippi to New Jersey (we only have samples MS to VA included in the dataset)
  * Structure suggests Mississippi is a separate genetic group

## Not directly related to either of these  projects but part of the same "Subsecundum complex" and interesting:
  * Diploid S. auriculatum also has S. subsecundum as one of its hybrid parents but is morphologically very similar to haploid S. auriculatum, while diploid S. lescurii is nearly identical to haploid S. lescurii. S. subsecundum apparently makes little contribution to the morphology of either of these hybrids. Unequal genome expression? S. auriculatum alleles code for more recessive traits?

# 2) Old (up to 1980's?) South American Spagnum samples

If we are willing to accept samples going back to the 1980's or 1990's, what SA Sphagnum are available in our herbarium and in other herbaria? Do some test extractions on some of our new and old samples to compare DNA quality. Run the raw extracted DNA out on a gel? Do digests with our RADseq REs and compare size distributions of fragments? Ligate and PCR amplify to see if we get similar results?

Are there Falkland Islands samples available? Are there Sphagnum on the Galapagos Islands? Four species in two subgenera [listed here][1]:
  * S. alegrense (Spagnum)
  * S. cuspidatum var serrulatum (Cuspidata)
  * S. perichaetiale (Sphagnum)
  * S. recurvum (Cuspidata)

# 3) Mapping RADseq loci to chromosomes

We have a bunch of RADseq loci from the S. recurvum project and we have a reference genome. Can we map the loci onto the chromosomes/contigs to see how well distributed they are. Calculate some basic stats to describe the degree of "well-distributedness"... something similar to how I described miRNA locations?
