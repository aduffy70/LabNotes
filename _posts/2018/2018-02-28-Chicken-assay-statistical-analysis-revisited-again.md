While working on the quail trapping and bioactivation data, we discovered problems with the spreadsheet for analyzing individual HPLC runs. Now that I have a better understanding of how this type of data should be analyzed, I want to take another look at the chicken trapping and bioactivation runs to see if I can reduce some of the within-Type variation. Also, we were calculating a V128 value (though it was not applicable for many runs that didn't use 128nm AFB as a test value) instead of a kcat.

Still focus just on the 2015 data for the same reasons as last time?  Or load all of the data into the new spreadsheets to see if I can identify why replicates from other years are consistent with each other but not consistent with the replicates from 2015?

Start with the 2015 data and see how much the recalculated values differ from the original values.

All of Deepika's runs and the first of Fran's runs use the AFB-gsh peak value directly instead of the AFB-gsh:AFG ratio.

Fran uses calculated CF values for the first two runs (0.889 and 0.914), then the average of those two CF values (0.902) for 10 runs, and then a new calculated CF value (0.919) for the next last two runs. The values are all similar. Use the average of the the 3 calculated values for all runs (0.907)?
