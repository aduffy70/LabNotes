While working on the quail trapping and bioactivation data, we discovered problems with the spreadsheet for analyzing individual HPLC runs. Now that I have a better understanding of how this type of data should be analyzed, I want to take another look at the chicken trapping and bioactivation runs to see if I can reduce some of the within-Type variation. Also, we were calculating a V128 value (though it was not applicable for many runs that didn't use 128nm AFB as a test value) instead of a kcat.

Still focus just on the 2015 data for the same reasons as last time?
