I have been using a CTAB DNA extraction protocol based on an old Soltis lab protocol. Have there been advances in the 25+ years since that protocol was developed that could improve my extractions. The CTAB protocol used for Sphagnum is very different and recently published protocols specifically designed for high-throughput sequencing are different as well. I need to look for possible improvements I can test on my filamentous filmy fern samples. Perhaps cleaner extractions would allow more consistent PCR-based species identifications.

What extraction protocol did Jerald use for the Didymoglossum identifications?
