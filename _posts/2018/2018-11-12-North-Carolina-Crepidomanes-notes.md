I am now a 90 minute drive from filmy fern populations. How can I take advantage of this?

Questions:
  * Are the filamentous gametophytes in this area actually _Crepidomanes intricatum_ or are they one of the other species?
    - Can I get/design primers that will consistently amplify each of the 3 species? Ideal would be mutually exclusive primers so I could quickly (without cloning) tell if there are significant numbers of individuals of more than one species in a sample? Working with fresh(er) tissue can I get away with smaller tissue samples? Retry direct PCR from individual filaments?
  * Are there other sites closer than Hanging Rock State Park and are there other nearby spots on National Forest or other land other than State Park (might be easier to get permission for a study)
  * What questions could I ask given access to a number of sites in a relatively small area. Obviously I could get better info on small-scale population structure, but what about dispersal-related questions or questions about the ecology?
