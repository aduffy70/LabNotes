  * 6 "populations" (New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi)
  * 37 genotypes with clones removed. Multiple (1-36) clones for all but one genotype in Mississippi. 666 total individuals?

Previous analyses:
* PCA (MS+FL group separately from the rest on first coordinate axis)
* Structure (K=2, MS + FL in one group, everything else in another. Almost no admixture except ~5% and ~1% in two NC genotypes)
*
