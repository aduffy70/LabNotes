# Problem

We have evidence for two genetic clusters of Sphagnum carolinianum, with Mississippi and Florida samples separate from everything else. We need to see what analysis has been done and look for Isolation by Distance.

# Data

Microsat data:
  * 12 loci (1, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28)
  * 6 "populations" assigned by state (New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi)
  * 61 samples but only 37 unique genotypes (clones). They only kept one individual of each clone so the final dataset has 37 individuals. The multiple samples in a set of clones were always from the same site (_i.e._, no genotype was found at multiple sites--there are no "widespread genotypes").

# Analysis

## Previous analyses
  * PCA (MS+FL group separately from the rest on first coordinate axis) -- I reran in R (with similar results/identical inferences) since I needed to run for the other species anyway.
  * Structure ("Best" K=2, MS + FL in one group, everything else in another. Almost no admixture except ~5% and ~1% in two NC genotypes)
    - I double-checked Mariana's existing parameters against the structure documentation and they are all either recommended defaults or make sense for this analysis.
    - They used v2.3.2.1 (Oct 2009). I reran at K=2 using 2.3.4 (Jul 2012) and got nearly identical results (to the 3rd decimal position on cluster assignment probabilities). I don't see any reason to redo this analysis.
  * Genalex
    - Fis for all pops together is negative for all but one locus... suggests higher than expected heterozygosity.  Wait. What does that even mean in a diploid gametophyte? These aren't two segregating alleles in a sporophyte. These are essentially two different loci (one originating in one parental species and the other originating in the other parental species... we just can't tell which is which now. There is no "expected" heterozygosity.

## Isolation By Distance (IBD)

  * This wasn't part of the previous analyses
  * Blanka georeferenced all but 3 locations. I located those 3 (to within about 1 mile) using Google Maps.
    - I have a [map of all 37 no-clone samples in Google maps][2]. ![Map image][image1]
    - It is concerning that the cluster2 samples in MS and FL are all 500 miles from everything while all other samples are within ~500 miles of each other. Could excluding samples between western FL and SC mislead Structure into finding 2 clusters if there is really a single cluster with IBD?
  * Generated a table of all pairwise combinations of sample coordinates so I can use an online calculator to calculate the distances.
  * Got the distances with [online calculator][1]
  * Categorize the comparisons two ways:
    - Cluster1 vs Cluster1, Cluster2 vs Cluster2, or Cluster1 vs Cluster2
    - Within cluster or Between cluster
  * Log10 transformed the geographic distances (appropriate for distances in 2D space) and looked for evidence of IBD with Mantel tests (9999 replicates) in R for all samples together and within the groups identified by Structure.
  * I replaced the 0's for missing data with -9's. The read.structure function I am using in R has a bug that causes problems with missing data coded as single 0's.

##  PCA

  Ran PCA and looked at K2 structure clusters and state/province in R (dudi.pca).

# Results

## Isolation By Distance (IBD)

  * There is evidence of IBD when including all 37 samples. Correlation=0.551, Mantel p<1e-04. But the Cluster2 samples all located in one area far from the Cluster1 could potentially cause this even if there was no IBD. So I looked at the two clusters separately. ![IBD plot by cluster][image2]
  * Cluster1 (the larger, more widespread Northern cluster) has evidence of IBD. Correlation=0.221, Mantel p<2e-04.
  * Cluster2 also has evidence of IBD. Correlation=0.399, Mantel p<0.0036.
  * It is worth noting that we are not really comparing apples-to-apples--Cluster2 has fewer samples and they are distributed over a much smaller geographic range than the Cluster1 samples.

## PCA

  * The 2 clusters are separated on principal component 1, which accounts for 12.2% of the variation.
  * The second PC (9.4% of the variation) just separates 3 of the North Carolina samples from the remaining Northern samples.
  * There is no clear clustering or separation based on State/Province.

# Questions/concerns

  * How does the apparent IBD affect our inferences from Structure? Could we not get the observed two-cluster Structure results just due to the 500mile gap in sampling combined with IBD?
  * Is AMOVA a useful tool for this analysis or will it have the same issues? (And other new issues because of the drastically different sizes of the clusters?)
  * Partial mantel tests of different distance ranges? Within cluster 1 or in everything? Mantel tests controlling for distance? What is the 2nd matrix in that case--Whether the comparisons are between or within clusters or whether they are within 1, within 2, or between 1 & 2?
