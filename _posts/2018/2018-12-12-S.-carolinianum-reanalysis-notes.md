Microsat data:
  * 12 loci (1, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28)
  * 6 "populations" assigned by state (New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi)
  * 61 samples but only 37 unique genotypes (clones). They only kept one individual of each clone so the final dataset has 37 individuals. The multiple samples in a set of clones were always from the same site (_i.e._, no genotype was found at multiple sites--there are no "widespread genotypes").

Previous analyses:
* PCA (MS+FL group separately from the rest on first coordinate axis)
* Structure (K=2, MS + FL in one group, everything else in another. Almost no admixture except ~5% and ~1% in two NC genotypes)
* Genalex
  - Fis for all pops together is negative for all but one locus... suggests higher than expected heterozygosity.  Wait. What does that even mean in a diploid gametophyte? These aren't two segregating alleles in a sporophyte. These are essentially two different loci (one originating in one parental species and the other originating in the other parental species... we just can't tell which is which now. There is no "expected" heterozygosity.
