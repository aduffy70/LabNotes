Microsat data:
  * 12 loci (1, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28)
  * 6 "populations" assigned by state (New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi)
  * 61 samples but only 37 unique genotypes (clones). They only kept one individual of each clone so the final dataset has 37 individuals. The multiple samples in a set of clones were always from the same site (_i.e._, no genotype was found at multiple sites--there are no "widespread genotypes").

Previous analyses:
* PCA (MS+FL group separately from the rest on first coordinate axis)
* Structure ("Best" K=2, MS + FL in one group, everything else in another. Almost no admixture except ~5% and ~1% in two NC genotypes)
  - I double-checked Mariana's existing parameters against the structure documentation and they are all either recommended defaults or make sense for this analysis.
  - They used v2.3.2.1 (Oct 2009). I reran at K=2 using 2.3.4 (Jul 2012) and got nearly identical results (to the 3rd decimal position on cluster assignment probabilities). I don't see any reason to redo this analysis.
* Genalex
  - Fis for all pops together is negative for all but one locus... suggests higher than expected heterozygosity.  Wait. What does that even mean in a diploid gametophyte? These aren't two segregating alleles in a sporophyte. These are essentially two different loci (one originating in one parental species and the other originating in the other parental species... we just can't tell which is which now. There is no "expected" heterozygosity.

Isolation By Distance (IBD):
  * This wasn't part of the previous analyses
  * Blanka georeferenced all but 3 locations. I located those 3 (to within about 1 mile) using Google Maps.
    - I have a [map of all 37 no-clone samples in Google maps][2]. ![Map image][image1]
    - It is concerning that the cluster 2 samples in MS and FL are all 500 miles from everything while all other samples are within ~500 miles of each other. Could excluding samples between western FL and SC mislead Structure into finding 2 clusters if there is really a single cluster with IBD?
  * Generated a table of all pairwise combinations of sample coordinates so I can use an online calculator to calculate the distances.
  * Got the distances with [online calculator][1]
  * Categorize the comparisons two ways:
    - Cluster1 vs Cluster1, Cluster2 vs Cluster2, or Cluster1 vs Cluster2
    - Within cluster or Between cluster
  * Used the structure formatted genotypes file and the file with distances as input to my Isolation_by_distance.R script to run the analysis.

IBD Results:
  * There is evidence of IBD when including all 37 samples. Correlation=0.438, Mantel p<1e-04. But our 2 clusters with the most genetically different samples all located in one area far from the rest of the samples could potentially cause this even if there was no IBD. So I looked at the two clusters separately. ![IBD plot by cluster][image2]
    - Cluster 1 (the larger, more widespread cluster) has evidence of IBD. Correlation=0.172, Mantel p<0.01.
    - Cluster 2 does not. Correlation=0.263, Mantel p<0.16.
        - It is worth noting that we are not really comparing apples-to-apples--Cluster 2 has fewer samples and they are distributed over a much smaller geographic range than the cluster 1 samples.
          - If we filter the pairwise comparisons for Cluster 1 to only include comparisons between samples in same geographic distance range as the Cluster 2 samples (<164km) then Cluster 1 barely meets the significance threshold. So the apparent lack of IBD in CLuster 2 could just be a result of the reduced geographic scale and doesn't really mean anything.
          - But if we compare the genetic distances between pairs of Cluster 2 samples and between the geographically similar (<164km) pairs of Cluster 1 samples the Cluster 1 samples DO generally have higher genetic distances. So there may be real differences in the distribution of genetic variability within each of the two clusters. [IBD plot, apples-to-apples][image3]
