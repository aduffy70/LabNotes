Microsat data:
  * 12 loci (1, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28)
  * 6 "populations" assigned by state (New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi)
  * 61 samples but only 37 unique genotypes (clones). They only kept one individual of each clone so the final dataset has 37 individuals. The multiple samples in a set of clones were always from the same site (_i.e._, no genotype was found at multiple sites--there are no "widespread genotypes").

Previous analyses:
* PCA (MS+FL group separately from the rest on first coordinate axis)
* Structure (K=2, MS + FL in one group, everything else in another. Almost no admixture except ~5% and ~1% in two NC genotypes)
  - I double-checked Mariana's existing parameters against the structure documentation and they are all either recommended defaults or make sense for this analysis.
  - They used v2.3.2.1 (Oct 2009). I reran at K=2 using 2.3.4 (Jul 2012) and got nearly identical results (to the 3rd decimal position on cluster assignment probabilities). I don't see any reason to redo this analysis.
* Genalex
  - Fis for all pops together is negative for all but one locus... suggests higher than expected heterozygosity.  Wait. What does that even mean in a diploid gametophyte? These aren't two segregating alleles in a sporophyte. These are essentially two different loci (one originating in one parental species and the other originating in the other parental species... we just can't tell which is which now. There is no "expected" heterozygosity.

Isolation By Distance (IBD):
  * This wasn't part of the previous analyses
  * Blanka georeferenced all but 3 locations. I located those 3 (to within about 1 mile) using Google Maps. I have a map of all 37 no-clone samples in Google maps. ![Map image][image1]
