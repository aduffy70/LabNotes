# CYP1A2 assay

CYP1A2 corresponds to CYP1A5 in turkeys.

Plated ~150K cells in a 96 well plate.
Background corrected and generated a standard curve to convert Relative Light Units (RLUs) to D-luciferin concentration:

|     | AFB treated (1hr @100nM) | Vehicle control (0.5% DMSO) | Untreated | Red blood cells |
| --- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Mean RLUs (6 reps) | 160.0 | 154.2 | 134.3 | 0.8 |
| [D-luciferin] in 100uL | 56.7nM | 54.9nM | 48.7nM | 0nM |
| Total D-luciferin | 5.7pmols | 5.5pmols | 49.pmols | 0pmols |

Is AFB-treated different than vehicle control?
  * No (p=0.4677)

Is AFB-treated different than untreated?
  * Yes (p=0.0065)

Conclusions:

  * Any effect of AFB treatment cannot be distinguished from effect of DMSO vehicle, so there does not appear to be a difference in CYP1A2 activity with AFB treatment.
  * Red blood cells do not appear to have CYP1A2 activity, so small levels of RBC contamination in our hepatocytes should not affect results.
  * The CYP1A2 in ~150K cells produces ~50pmols of D-luciferin in 1hr.

Open questions:

  * Can this activity level tell us anything about how much CYP1A2 is present in our cells? No, but if we use purified turkey CYP1A5 to generate a standard curve to convert RLUs to amount of CYP we would be able to say that this level of CYP1A2 activity in our ~150K cells is equivalent to the activity of XX pmols of purified turkey CYP1A2.
