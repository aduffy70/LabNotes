In response to Bryan's question about how I defined a fixed difference between species pairs:

I allowed for missing data but required that the locus be present in at least 50% of the samples in each species, _i.e._, if we have data for the majority of samples in each species and they don't share any alleles, it is a fixed difference.

I have scripts to do this.
