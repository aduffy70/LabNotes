I have been tracking water levels at the "bog" in Duke Forest using a motion sensitive game cam pointed at a yardstick tied to a tree near the deepest part of the pond. Photos are taken anytime an animal triggers the camera, which happens almost every day. The ruler is marked with red marker in alternating 10cm increments to make it easier to read on the photos.

I started taking photos in August 2020 and it has been collecting data continuously since. Batteries in the camera need to be changed periodically, but I have left it running 5 months on a set of batteries with no issues. Photos are stored in my ShawLab dropbox.

After about 9 months I manually recorded the water levels from the photos but I was not consistent in how I recorded the water levels when the pool is lower than the bottom of the yardstick. I need to decide on a system for how to record those lower depths and then generate the data for the last 18 months.

I started doing this because we visited the site very sporadically and often at the same time of year each visit so we had no clear idea of how ephemeral the pool actually is. It does fluctuate seasonally and with the weather. We have talked about conducting a study at that site and my hope is that these data will be useful for that effort.
