# Problem

For Juan Jaramillo-Chico's _Sphagnum subnitens_/_subfulvum_/_incundum_/etc dataset we want to analyze the chloroplast loci separate from the rest of the RADseq loci.

# Process

The data:

  * For the 4 _in silico_ samples in his sample set, I used the new _in silico_ digested chloroplast genome "RADseq" reads.
  * For the "real" samples I used the same demultiplexed RADseq files he has been using.

In ipyrad:

  * I mapped to a _Sphagnum fallax_ chloroplast genome from Genbank (KU725463.1)
  * Used other settings from his previous runs
  * Kept loci present in >= 60% of samples (like his previous runs)

Ran iqtree:

  * Kept best of 10 runs using the MFP-selected best model.

# Results

  * Output files in Dropbox/My_Shaw_Lab/For_others/Subnitens_subfulvum-Juan/Chloroplast_loci_only
  * 47 loci
  * Decently resolved tree for 47 loci.
