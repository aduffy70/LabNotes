1. What does the ploidy appear to be based on error?
2. Based on preliminary trees is there any reason to question whether that ploidy is correct? Does it match the rest of the clade?
3. Does that ploidy match what is known for the species from previous ploidy work or microsats?
4. If there is a mismatch or reason to question it, is it a borderline case based on the error or does it seem convincing?
