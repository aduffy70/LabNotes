What is the story I want to tell and what results do I need?

# Three species story

  * There are 3 species of filamentous independent gametophytes that are common in the Eastern US that can't be differentiated visually, but we can differentiate them using RADseq data
    * Structure K3 results showing which species group with the sporophytes and which group separately (Crepidomanes). Does the 50p data show this or do we need to give a justification for 50sporo or 33sporo data?
  * Once we know species we can see just how bad the species bias in missing data is and correct for it to make datasets for further analyses.
    * Venns showing the species bias in missing data and how correcting for it in filtering makes it better.
  * With an unbiased dataset and eliminating admixed samples, we can look at relationships among the 3 species and compare genetic differentiation stats.
    * Genetic differentiation stats, pairwist Fst, etc.
    * ML trees, distance trees, PCA, others(?) showing separation of the samples in each species.
  * Identification based on presence/absence of sporophytes is problematic.
    * Table showing collector species IDs vs RADseq IDs (include evidence used to determine collector species ID) to show that identification based on presence/absence of sporophytes is problematic.
    * Table of PCR identifications? Can I complete that table with additional PCR runs?
  * Are there useful morphologic features we can identify now that we have a set of identified specimens? I need to work on this.

# Crepidomanes population genetics

  * There is little apparent structure among Crepidomanes samples.
    * ML trees. distance trees, PCA, genotype networks, others?
  * Many samples are similar enough to represent clones.
    * Analysis of re-sampled pseudoclones.
  * Inclusion of multiple individuals in each sample is problematic.
    * What can we do to try to analyze these as population samples rather than individuals and what does that tell us?
  * What can we actually say about population genetics of Crepidomanes intricatum??
