We are generating and sequencing RADseq libraries from _Sphagnum_ DNAs extracted bu Gustaf Granath's group at Uppsala University in Sweden.

Plate 1: 94 samples (and 2 duplicates). 2022-03-04
  * Melodie Najarro generated this library while I observed/helped.
  * Sequencing center rejected the library for low concentration after their cleaning/filtering step, so I re-PCRd 17 samples with little PCR product left and created a new library pool. I did not bead clean this time--the sequencing center will do it.

Plate 2: 94 samples (and 2 duplicates). 2022-03-09
  * I generated this library.
