# GrTS How should I engage an audience when presenting research?

Ideas for presenting research to an audience from the Graduate Training Series. This was held 2016-11-16 but I never copied over the notes.

Presentations:

  * Punchline up front- don't make it a mystery novel
  * Minimize text


Posters:

  * Attractive but not glitzy
  * How do you hook someone walking by?
  * minimize text
  * mini versions for people to take with them
  * business cards with contact info

Interviews:

  * understand what they are after
  * get questions in advance
  * prepare your key points
  * imagine sitting with a friend
  * boil it down to plain english
  * condense and simplify
  * avoid filler words

Elevator pitch:

  * Pitches for different lengths of time: 30 second and 90 second
  * Different pitch for science audience vs general audience
  * Anecdote, statistic, or short story to capture attention
  * Answer the question "So what? Who cares?"
  * Show your passion. How do you get interested in this? why do you do this?
  * Be clear about why someone should care about your research
  * Write down the pitches... start with the longest and edit down to get shorter
  * Practice it on people
  * Maintain eye contact and use open posture
  * Don't feel like you have to explain the details
  * Avoid jargon and terminology

Getting press:

  * Have one paragraph in a paper that explains things at a high school level to encourage it to be picked up by science journalists
  * simplify figures so high schoolers can understand
  * Be ready for bad press... make the obvious joke before they do so maybe they'll use yours instead of making up a worse one

Idea: Comic figure with poison-labeled food and a healthy mouse, sick chicken and really sick turkey... and then add in a less sick wild turkey

How to reach the media:

  * Have a press kit ready before the paper comes out
  * Work with PR office in advance
  * Photos videos... do this while the paper is in review
  * Distribute to media the day the paper is released
    * Eurekalert
  * When a paper is accepted, can you come up with a cover idea for them, mock it up and offer them the concept?
  * tell the PR rep everything you have coming out and let them help decide whether it has a story
