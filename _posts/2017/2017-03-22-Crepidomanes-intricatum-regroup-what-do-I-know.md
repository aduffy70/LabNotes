# Problem:

I suspect that some of the "Crepidomanes intricatum" samples I used for GBS are actually Vandenboschia boschiana, Didymoglossum petersii, or possibly a 4th filmy fern species, and some of the V.bos, and D.pet gametophyte samples I included in the analysis may be C.int.

# Data I have:

## rbcL-atpB spacer

  * I have sequences from 5 suspected C.int and 1 messy but useable sequence from suspected V.bos.
    * C.int sequences are identical. Blast to ???
    * V.bos is clearly different. Blast to ???
  * These sequences also overlap with the first 22-53 bases of most of the filmy fern rbcL sequences in NCBI. Obviously the suspected C.int sequences are most similar to C.schmid, but which species is this section of the suspected V.bos most similar to?

## rbcL

  * I have sequences from 5 suspected C.int only. Some more complete and cleaner than others.
    * Sequences are practically identical to each other and to Ebihara's C.schmid sequence.
    *


## trnS-rps4 spacer

  * I have sequences from 2 suspected C.int
    * Sequences are identical. Blast to Ebihara's T.int and C.schmid.

## trnL-trnF spacer (~450bp)

  * I have sequences from 4 suspected C.int and 1 suspected V.bos.
    * C.int sequences are identical. Blast to ???
    * V.bos is clearly different. Blast to ???
  * Amplified one V.bos sporophyte (S29). Haven't attempted to sequence.
  * Failed to amplify D. pet sporophytes or suspected 4th spp.
  * Few filmy fern trnL-trnF sequences in NCBI. None in the needed genera/subgenera.
