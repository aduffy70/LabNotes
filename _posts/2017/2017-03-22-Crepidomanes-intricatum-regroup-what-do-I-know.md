# Problem:

I suspect that some of the "Crepidomanes intricatum" samples I used for GBS are actually Vandenboschia boschiana, Didymoglossum petersii, or possibly a 4th filmy fern species, and some of the V.bos, and D.pet gametophyte samples I included in the analysis may be C.int.

# Data I have:

## rbcL-atpB spacer

  * I have sequences from 5 suspected C.int and 1 messy but useable sequence from suspected V.bos.
    * C.int sequences are identical. Blast to C. latealatum (correct subgenus/section) with 95% identity.
    * V.bos is clearly different. Blast to Vandenboschia birmanica in two pieces (because of the indel) with 86% and 94% identity.
  * These sequences also overlap with the first 22-53 bases of most of the filmy fern rbcL sequences in NCBI. Obviously the suspected C.int sequences are most similar to C.schmid, but which species is this section of the suspected V.bos most similar to?

## rbcL

  * I have sequences from 5 suspected C.int only. Some more complete and cleaner than others.
    * Sequences are practically identical to each other and to Ebihara's C.schmid sequence.
  * Amplified from V.bos sporophyte, and a shorter section (H1F1-F1379R) in D.pet sporophyte
  * Failed on suspected 4th spp with 26F-F1379R but haven't tried other primers yet.
  * Many filmy fern rbcL sequences in NCBI in the needed subgenera. [Listed here.][1]


## trnS-rps4 spacer

  * I have sequences from 2 suspected C.int
    * Sequences are identical. Blast to Ebihara's T.int and C.schmid.
  * Failed to amplify D.pet sporophytes, V.bos sporophytes or suspected gametophytes, or suspected 4th spp.
  * A few filmy fern trnS-rps4 sequences in NCBI in the needed subgenera:
    * Vandenboschia subgenus Vandenboschia: V. speciosa, V. radicans
    * Didymoglossum subgenus Didymoglossum: D. membranaceum, D. krausii, D. hildebrandtii
    * Crepidomanes subgenus Crepidomanes section Crepidomanes: C. intricatum, C. schmidtianum

## trnL-trnF spacer (~450bp)

  * I have sequences from 4 suspected C.int and 1 suspected V.bos.
    * C.int sequences are identical. Blast to Hymenophyllum spp
    * V.bos is clearly different. Blast to Hymenophyllum spp
  * Amplified one V.bos sporophyte (S29). Haven't attempted to sequence.
  * Failed to amplify D. pet sporophytes or suspected 4th spp.
  * Few filmy fern trnL-trnF sequences in NCBI. None in the needed genera/subgenera.
