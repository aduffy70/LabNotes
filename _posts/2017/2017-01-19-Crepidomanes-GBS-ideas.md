Two thoughts for getting around my issues getting chloroplast markers to ID my GBS samples to species:

  1. I don't _have_ to have the same marker for all species. If I can get one marker that lets me ID some samples and then I can get another marker for some of those samples I can use the second marker to ID samples where I couldn't get the first marker.
  2. When I ran my GBS analysis I excluded the samples I thought were other species and the sporophyte sample that I know are other species. If I included those sporophytes in the analysis, will they form clusters with the samples that are their species? Paul Wolf recommended looking at a program Zach Gompert is using called Entropy... it is similar to Structure but designed for SNP data.
