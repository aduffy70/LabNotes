Things to show/explain:
  * Why I chose the 0.85 clustering threshold
  * Why I chose the diploid, rather than haploid setting
  * Why I left the maximum cluster depth setting alone

Analyses to try:
  * Run with all samples and see which gametophytes group with the known sporophytes to try to confirm species assignments.
  * Run with just samples that have the best support for actually being Crepidomanes.
