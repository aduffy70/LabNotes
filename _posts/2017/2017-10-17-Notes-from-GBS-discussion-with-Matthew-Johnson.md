* His [structure pipeline on Github][1]
* Look into RADCap (developed at UGA?)- can use hybridization probes to grab specific loci found from GBS. You can choose the "best" GBS loci and get data for just those to reduce the amount of missing data in a dataset.
* Publications to look for for:
  - "Breaking Rad" - discussing caveats and limits of ddRad/GBS data analysis
  - Book chapter on RAD sequencing by Ree and Hip (correct spelling?)
  - Sphagnum paper(s?) by Mariana Ricca for info on an R package she used to analyze diploid gametophytes
