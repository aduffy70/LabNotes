# Problem:

Twice now I have started PCR runs with my 3step PCR thermocycler protocol and it has paused at the hotstart stage when I don't think I set the HotStart option to YES.

The first time I didn't notice until after my samples had been sitting at 95C for 2 hours. This time I caught it immediately and resumed the run.

I haven't seen this with my other protocols. Is there something I have accidentally set in the program that is making this happen? Or am I just accidentally swithching the HotStart option to YES at the beginning of the run?  Test and find out.
