# Problem:

Twice now I have started PCR runs with my 3-step PCR thermocycler protocol (threestep) on the normal (non-RTqPCR) cycler and it has paused at the hotstart stage when I don't think I set the HotStart option to YES.

The first time I didn't notice until after my samples had been sitting at 95C for 2 hours. This time I caught it immediately and resumed the run.

I haven't seen this with my other protocols. Is there something I have accidentally set in the program that is making this happen? Or am I just accidentally switching the HotStart option to YES at the beginning of the run?  Test and find out.

# Solution:

It looks like there is nothing wrong with the protocol. If I use the down arrow instead of the right arrow to scroll between fields it changes the NO to YES. I must be doing this. Strange it hasn't happened before, but I started a test run and it worked correctly. Operator error.
