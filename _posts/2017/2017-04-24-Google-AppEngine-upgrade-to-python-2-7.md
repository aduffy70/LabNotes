Google has deprecated python 2.5 for Google AppEngine, so all my tools will be shut down 2017-05-16 unless I upgrade to python 2.7. This requires some fairly significant changes so I am only upgrading projects I really need:

  * my tasklist and notelist tools - Unused. Shut them down.
  * vpgsimplots - vpgsim is broken on current Ubuntu versions. Shut it down.
  * vpcsim - VPCsim is still being used by teachers. Upgrade it.
  * diversitydb - No new data since 2014-09. Shut it down.
