What do we know and what still needs to be completed?

# GSTA3

There is no CpG island upstream of GSTA3. There are only 88 CpGs spread over 11000bp, but there are 4 CpG "reefs" (areas with more CpGs than the average in this area but not nearly as concentrated as the obvious islands upstream of other genes). We designed bisulfite sequencing primers to capture 37 of the 88 CpGs (42%) in four ~500bp fragments (17% of the region).

  * Reef A (12 CpGs ~2400bp upstream of the transcription start site):
    *
  * Reef B (8 CpGs ~50bp upstream of the ):
    *
  * Reef C (10 CpGs):
  * Reef D (7 CpGs)

# GSTA4

There is a CpG island upstream of GSTA4.

The Zymo OneStep kit worked on the 5' half:

  * Low methylation (1.5%) and no difference between Wild and Domestic.

The Zymo kit won't work on the 3' half due to very high GC content and exactly matching sequence on chromosome 1 preventing clean amplification of large fragments or designing unique primers to amplify the 350bp fragments recommended by Zymo. To continue we will have to bisulfite sequence.


# Nrf2

There was a gap in the genome assembly upstream of Nrf2 (NFE2L2) so we couldn't tell if there was a CpG island there or not.

We sequenced the gap and there IS an island.  We have designed and successfully tested primers to cleanly amplify three ~300bp sections of the island.

We need to use those primers with the Zymo OneStep kit.
