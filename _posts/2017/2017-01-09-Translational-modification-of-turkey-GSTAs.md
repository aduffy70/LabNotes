One of the suggestions from Roger Coulombe's presentation on our progress to funders:

Doug Rhoads suggested looking into possible RNA editing or translational modifications of the GSTAs that lead to differences in the translated protein in Domestic turkeys, even though there aren't critical differences in the DNA or mRNA sequences. This editing wouldn't happen in the proteins expressed in E.coli so they would have been functional in that experiment while still being non- (or less-) functional in the liver.

Differences between the Wild and Domesticated turkey proteins can possibly be detected if we use affinity columns to pull out just the GSTAs and then do mass spectrometry to look for differences. Rhoads' lab (or someone they work with?) can do the mass spectrometry if we can do the affinity column work here.

Sean Moody found columns that capture specific proteins using GST-tags by:
  1. lysing cells,
  2. binding GSTs to a desired protein in the lysate,
  3. binding the GST-tagged proteins to the column,
  4. washing away everything else,
  5. releasing the GST-tagged proteins from the column by flooding with glutathione,
  6. separating the desired protein from the GSTs, and
  7. filtering out the GSTs and glutathione leaving just the desired proteins.

We talked to the technicians at GE.com and confirmed that this kit could be used to capture the GSTs already present in cells by:
  1. lysing cells,
  2. binding the GSTs in the lysate to the column,
  3. washing away everything else,
  4. releasing the GSTs from the column by flooding with glutathione, and
  5. filtering out the glutathione so we have just GSTs.

Their only caveat is that the GSTs bind to the column and then get released from the column through conjugation with glutathione. That means that if the hypothesized translational modification changes the glutathione conjugation ability of the protein we won't capture those modified GSTs in the column. This would be a problem with other methods too... if we use an antibody to capture GSTs we will only capture the GSTs if the modification doesn't affect the sites that the antibody is binding.

We ordered a small kit from ThermoFisher to test the process.

The columns are reusable if they are flushed with sodium azide. We purchased some from USU chem store, but it comes with some terrifying warnings--this chemical will explode if it comes in contact with metals and can be fatal with ingestion or even skin contact! We attached a very large warning label to the container.

# Diluting sodium azide

Each column requires 5mL of 0.05% w/v sodium azide in water. This dilution can be stored and handled with normal lab precautions but getting it into this dilution from powder must be done with extreme caution. To dilute from powder:

  * We worked entirely in the hood. Moved the scale to the hood. Placed it on a large paper sheet to cover the metal surface of the hood. Covered the metal scale platform with paper and dispensed into a plastic weigh boat. Dispensed by gently tapping/pouring from the container to avoid metal instruments.
  * 500 mg Sodium azide in 1L water. (Since 0.050g/100mL = 0.05%)
  * Mixed by swirling to avoid risk of contacting metal in a magnetic stir rod. It went into solution almost immediately with about a minute of swirling to break up some lumps.
  * Stored the leftover powder (we only used 0.5g out of the 25g) in the locked firebox with the controlled substances. The bottle is still labeled with a huge tag warning of the dangers of using metal instruments.
