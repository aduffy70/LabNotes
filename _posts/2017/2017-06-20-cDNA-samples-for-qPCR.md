We have cDNA samples and dilutions from Deepika Gaddam's qPCR/Fluidigm runs.

Tiny amounts (1-5uL?) of undiluted samples and larger amounts (20uL?) of 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions.

12 tubes of each of 4 types. Tubes are labeled:
  * R (Rio Grande?) 1,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,13,14,17
  * B (BB White?) (2,3,4,5,8,9-AFB),(10,11,12,14,16,17-Control)
  * N (Nicholas) 1,2,3,5,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18
  * E (Eastern Wild) (1,2,3,4,5,8-AFB),(9,10,11,14,15,16-Control)

I want to Eastern Wild and BB White(?) Since that is what we used on the fluidigm analysis.

Nanodrop the 1:20 samples (from 1/5/15 -- these are the most clearly labeled) to see what range of concentrations we have:

| Sample | Concentration (ng/uL) |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| B2 | 120.0 |
| B3 | 41.7 |
| B4 | 76.0 |
| B5 | 73.2 |
| B8 | 49.6 |
| B9 | 65.5 |
| B10 | 59.0 |
| B11 | 86.2 |
| B12 | 96.4 |
| B14 | 70.0 |
| B16 | 171.9 |
| B17 | 121.4 |
| E1 | 87.2 |
| E2 | 225.7 |
| E3 | 178.8 |
| E4 | 137.0 |
| E5 | 66.7 |
| E8 | 90.4 |
| E9 | 70.3 |
| E10 | 146.2 |
| E11 | 102.7 |
| E14 | 80.0 |
| E15 | 183.2 |
| E16 | 59.3 |
