Graduate Training Series presentation by Mary-Ann Muffoletto, PR specialist

Take-away ideas:
  * Remember- your audience isn't stupid; they just don't know what you know.
    - stick to major ideas, keep it simple, elegant, refined, and watch the jargon/acronyms.
      - What am I looking for?
      - What problem am I trying to solve?
      - Why is it interesting to me?
  * Photos for press releases:
    - get a good high quality, high resolution photo of yourself on a neutral background with wide margins so they can crop as wanted.
    - get good field/lab photos with people in them. Always wear appropriate safety gear in the photos.
