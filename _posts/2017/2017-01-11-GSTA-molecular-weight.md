What is the approximate expected molecular weight of the GSTA proteins we hope to isolate with affinity columns and analyze with mass spectrometry?

  * In turkeys [Kim et al 2013][1]:
    * 28kDa in Domestic, Eastern Wild, Rio Grande, and Royal Palm
  * In fish (largemouth bass) [Pham et al 2004][2]:
    * "Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and electrospray ionization analysis of the major bass GST subunit yielded a molecular weight of 26,396 kDa."
    * "LC–MS analysis revealed molecular weights of 26,396 and 25,508 Da for the two putative GST forms, which are within the typical mass range for GST subunits"
