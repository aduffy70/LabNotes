What is the approximate expected molecular weight of the GSTA proteins we hope to isolate with affinity columns and analyze with mass spectrometry?

  * In turkeys (recombinant E.coli-expressed proteins) [Kim et al 2013][1]:
    * Approximately 26-28kDa in Domestic, Eastern Wild, Rio Grande, and Royal Palm. Exact values are provided in the paper for GSTA1.1, GSTA1.2, GSTA1.3, GSTA2, GSTA3, and GSTA4... but all for the recombinant proteins--not proteins generated by the turkey liver cells.
  * In fish (largemouth bass) [Pham et al 2004][2]:
    * "Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and electrospray ionization analysis of the major bass GST subunit yielded a molecular weight of 26,396 kDa."
    * "LC–MS analysis revealed molecular weights of 26,396 and 25,508 Da for the two putative GST forms, which are within the typical mass range for GST subunits"
