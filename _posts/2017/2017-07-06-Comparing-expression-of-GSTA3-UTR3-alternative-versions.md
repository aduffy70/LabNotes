# qPCR runs

PCR0292
  * Good data
  * 2 technical replicates of all 24 samples for UTR3-A and GSTA_cds

PCR0293
  * in process
  * 2 technical replicates of all 24 samples for UTR3-B and UTR3-C

PCR0294
  * Still to run to run
  * 2 technical replicates of all 24 samples for UTR3-D

Total reactions:
  * 192 experimental reactions (2 replicates X 24 samples X 4 primerpairs)
  * 96 housekeeping/normalization reactions shared with the GSTA3 UTR5 runs (2 replicates X 24 samples X 2 primerpairs)

# Analysis

## Data cleaning
  * Removed one replicate of B17 with Ct of ~22. It is >7Ct lower than the other replicate and outside the range of all other measurements for any type treatment.
  * No other missing data
