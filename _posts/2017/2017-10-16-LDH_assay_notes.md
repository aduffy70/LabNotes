Moving things around to make the setup sheets and protocol more accessible in the lab:

* Setup sheets for LDH time studies (viability) and cytotoxicity studies are in Google Drive.
* Protocol with recipes is on Github.
* Results are in my Coulombe_lab/LDH_assay_test folder

For the time series, we change the media in all wells before timepoint zero and don't change them again over the rest of the study. At each timepoint we add assay mix to one set of wells and take a reading.

For the cytotoxicity study, we change the media and add 60uL media plus 60uL of a phenol dilution, incubate for 2 hours, add assay mix, and take a reading.
