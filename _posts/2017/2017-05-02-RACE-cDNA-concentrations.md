After switching tubes of June's RACE cDNA (when the first one ran out) I started getting high molecular weight smears on my minigels suggesting my PCR template concentration is too high.

Nanodropped all RACE cDNAs (and labeled them with red 'D' numbers):

| Tube | ng/uL DNA |
| --- | --- |
| CT 5' D1 | 109.5 |
| CT 5' D2 | empty |
| CT 5' D3 | 80.8 |
| CT 5' D4 | 67.6 |
| CT 5' D5 | 81.8 |
| CT 5' D6 | 44.9 |
| CT 5' D7 | empty |
| CT 3' D1 | 74.0 |
| CT 3' D2 | 45.4 |
| CT 3' D3 | 68.7 |
| CT 3' D4 | 27.3 |
| CT 3' D5 | 117.8 |
| EW 5' D1 | 57.7 |
| EW 3' D1 | 45.9 |
| EW 3' D2 | 96.0 |
