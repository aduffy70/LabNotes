Working with Sean Moody to troubleshoot process to get primary cells from turkey livers. We suspect we have not been getting good digestion of the liver with the collagenase/hylalonurudase buffer.

[Here are][1] a [couple][2] videos that show the results of liver digestion in other organisms. Our turkey livers have not disolved this well.

# Ideas:

  * Our livers are larger than chickens so we may need to scale things up from the chicken protocols we have been following
  * Other than immediately after the cannulation, our livers don't really swell when you block the output like shown in the rat video.
  * The lamb liver piece in the video is not much larger than a large turkey liver and they are using multiple cannulae and pumping a lot of fluid through. They also recycle the fluid so it might not take as much.
  * We aren't covering the liver to maintain moisture.
  * How do the 250-400 U/ml collagenase activities (for 25-80g livers) compare to ours?
  * They are spinning their cells at higher rates (72G) for longer times (5 minutes).
  * They are getting digestion in 9-12 minutes. Longer times gave them better digestion but lower cell viabilities. Each cannula has a flow rate of about 40mL/min, which is higher than we are using.
  * Two different protocols suggest using 100mg of Collagenase A in 500uL of buffer. [According to Sigma][3], Collagenase A is >0.15U/mg, so that is 15U. We are adding 4U of Collagenase Type II in our base protocol. The run that gave partial digestion in one lobe used 20U. **There are two methods of calculating U/mg... one that gives 0.15U/mg for Collagenase A and one that gives 250U/mg. Which method was used to get the U/mg value for our Collagenase type II?**
