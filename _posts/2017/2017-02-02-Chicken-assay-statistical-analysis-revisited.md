I [previously][1] analyzed chicken AFBO trapping assay data for Fran Bhushan and found no statistically significant differences between the chicken types. I need to take a deeper look at those data to determine what else I can draw out of it.

# About the dataset

  * Comparing 3 chicken types: Broiler, Fayoumi, and Leghorn
  * Assays were repeated twice for 3 birds of each type (between 2015-01-22 and 2015-10-23)
  * A fourth bird of each type was assayed once (on 2016-12-15, 2016-01-20, or 2016-01-22 -- really a typo of January 2017?)
  * For one replicated, one of the Broilers (B27-4) was measured at a different AFB concentration? 114uM instead of 128 like all the others. This also has the lowest r-square value of any other sample-replicate (0.92).
