# Problem

I have confirmed (PCR and sequencing) 3 versions of the GSTA3 5'UTR and 4 versions of the 3'UTR. Now I want to know how the relative levels of these different versions of the mRNA differ in Wild and Domestic turkeys with and without AFB treatment.

# Strategy

Design primer pairs that selectively amplify a single version. Use qPCR on cDNAs from Wild and Domestic turkeys with and without AFB treatment to compare expression levels.

Use housekeeping genes to normalize? Use GSTA3 coding sequence (cds)? Both?
  * Using housekeeping genes shows more directly how the expression of each changes, but we already know that GSTA3 expression in general changes so we might not be able to detect smaller changes in individual versions.
  * Using GSTA3 coding sequence will show how expression of different versions changes as a proportion of total GSTA3 expression.
  * Can I make valid comparisons between things amplified with different primer sets? In one type-treatment, if version A amplifies better than version B, does that mean it has higher expression or could it just be that one primer set is better optimized to the PCR conditions? Will I be able to make statements about the relative expression of the different versions or only about how the expression of each version changes between type-treatments?
