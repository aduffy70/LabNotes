One of the suggestions from Roger Coulombe's presentation on our progress to funders:

Doug Rhoads suggested looking into possible RNA editing of the GSTAs that leads to differences in the translated protein in Domestic turkeys, even though there aren't critical differences in the DNA or mRNA sequences. The editing wouldn't happen in the proteins expressed in E.coli so they would have been functional in that experiment while still being non- (or less-) functional in the liver.

Differences between the Wild and Domesticated turkey proteins can possibly be detected if we use affinity columns to pull out just the GSTAs and then do mass spectrometry to look for differences. Rhoads' lab (or someone they work with?) can do the mass spectrometry if we can do the affinity column work here.

Sean Moody is looking into kits to separate out GSTA proteins.
