Notes on the sample namimg system used for Gustaf Granath's _S. divinum_ and _S. medium_ RADseq samples:

There are samples for three different projects:
  1. A student's morphology study. Samples from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Ireland, and Czech Republic.
  2. A disturbance study. Samples from a single peatland in southern Sweden with disturbed and natural grid sites, and a selection of samples from across Europe.
  3. Climate chamber experiments.
  
Sample name prefix meanings:  
  * SM = disturbance/natural grid site samples
  * NL = Netherlands
  * LI = Lithuania
  * G = Germany
  * CR = Czech Republic
  * A = Austria
  * R = Russia
  
The Netherlands, Lithuania, Germany, and Czech Republic samples are the Climate chamber experiment samples.
