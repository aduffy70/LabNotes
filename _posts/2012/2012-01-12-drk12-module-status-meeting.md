Attending: Max Longhurst, Brett Shelton, (Todd Campbell for the first couple minutes)

  * Jan 24- teacher leader meeting for full day
  * Mar 6 another full day w/teacher leaders
  * Pilot after May 15 sometime (21-25?)

On the 24th we want to show the teachers whatever we have and talk about where we are going so they can give feedback before we are totally committed. On the 6th we want to have the software working and the module drafted so they can critic and adjust the module.Â  For the pilot, obviously it all needs to be ready for students.
