  * Teaching iSIT summer Professional Development for Cohorts 1 & 2 at Woods Cross High.
    * Spent some time walking through an example of setting up a google group.
    * A really cool mashup of hardware and the web.  <http://www.stoneskippingrobot.com/> Use a web interface to control a robot that skips stones on a lake in Sun Valley, Idaho.  It shows it on live video stream and gives you a link to a copy of the video.  Adjust the robot's parameters to try to get more skips.
