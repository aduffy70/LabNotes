  <ul>
    <li>
      Got feedback/guidance from teacher leaders on VPCsim for Module 3: <ul>
        <li>
          Focus on Standard 2 Objective 2 but leave in as much of the human impact stuff (Objective 3) so that this tool could also be used as another option as part of Module 1 if teachers run into problems accessing real-world sampling sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide controls for water levels, light levels, and temperature with choices between 'normal', 'low', and 'high'.  Tie those to actual numeric values if possible but only give students the three choices as opposed to continuously adjustable values.  Make the values consistent across the landscape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simplify the options on the setup form as much as possible but leave everything they need for all three rounds of inquiry.  As part of the teacher's instruction they will focus the students' attention on which parts to use in the earlier rounds... we don't need a technological solution to making the form have fewer options in earlier rounds of inquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Give the trees names that tie them to native plants (and a few invasives or non-natives).  When the students choose the plants, give them information about the plants, and what environment they are adapted to.  When you have the tentative list of plant names, bounce them off the teacher leaders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a way for them to save or print out a summary of the selections they made when setting up the environment and picking plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a way to save or print out their results
        </li>
        <li>
          More focus on provided graphs/plots and less on the log of actual numbers.  They need access to the numbers to understand what the plots show, but we don't want them to get so distracted creating their own plots from the log data that they lose the connection between what they did to change the simulation and the results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have ability to overlay plots - one plot with buttons to toggle the different data types?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is it possible to have a 'null' plant option in case they only want to choose one plant (or fewer than 5)?  Currently the only way to do this is to choose the same plant multiple times which will skew starting quantities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data to report for each species: <ul>
            <li>
              number of individuals
            </li>
            <li>
              average age
            </li>
            <li>
              total biomass (could be calculated from size and number of individuals).  The size of plants is currently based only on age but now the environmental parameters will need to play a part in that calculation.
            </li>
            <li>
              oxygen output or CO2 usage?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Provide a way to see where the player is located (X, Z coordinates and altitude)
        </li>
        <li>
          Can we drop a virtual 'hula hoop' for manual sampling?
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a 'sampling mode' that locks the camera at a particular height above terrain focused straight down so they can use the part of the world visible in the window as a consistently-sized sampling plot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soundtrack? :^)  Uh... no.  We will have multiple computers in one room all running the program at the same time.  Anything beyond sounds to provide feedback to button presses will get to be annoying.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Overall, the response to what I've developed so far was very positive and the group is supportive of the general plan for the module - using a flexible simulation tool to do experiments where students can test the effects of changing different aspects of the environment.
    </li>
  </ul>
