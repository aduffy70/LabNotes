  * We have $250 we need to spend this week or we lose it so I checked stocks and supplies in the lab.  We have basic supplies (gloves, wipes, tips, tubes) and everything needed for DNA extraction and PCR reactions/cleanup (PEG-style).  Suggested we get pipettes calibrated instead:
      * 1000 uL - 9
      * 200 uL - 6
      * 100 uL - 2
      * 20 uL - 6
      * 10 uL - 5
      * 2 uL - 3
      * Can't locate the digital pipetter or the multi-pipetter
      * At $23 each, calibrating all of these (31 total) is $713.  We don't really need all of these - many were scavenged from the Pfrender lab.
      * I suggest just 3 of each (15 total, none of the 100 uL) so we have a Pre-PCR, Post-PCR, and RNA set of pipetters for $345.
      * At Paul's instruction, I talked to Stephanie White to get the order placed for just the 15 on the Buckwheat grant.
      * Need to check them and see which 15 seem worst so we get the worst one fixed and the backups are the ones that already seem to be adjusted correctly.
  * Finalized H. wrightii draft and emailed it to Don Farrar and Mary Stensvold
  * Emailed Brett Shelton and Ethan White to schedule time this week to discuss my projects and hopefully get them signed on to my committee
