  1. Start downloading Imprudence Viewer as they arrive - just download and install for now
      1. Pass out Intro to VPGsim & ScienceSim
  2. Brief (3-5 minute) intro to what the simulation and activity are about
      1. Drawbacks to real world experiments & Advantages of simulations for population genetics
          1. Ask them for potential drawbacks/challenges?
              1. time & $$$
              2. sample size
              3. unknown variables
              4. controls / repeatability
              5. can't "see" individual level interactions - only population level patterns
          2. Potential drawbacks to simulations?
              1. accurate models
              2. over-simplification?
              3. applicability to real world
      2. The plan:
          1. Use a population of simulated organisms in a controlled environment
          2. 2 Experiments - one we design together, one on their own
          3. Working in groups of 3 or 4
          4. focus on making connections between individual-level interactions and population-level patterns
          5. Use VPGsim, within ScienceSim
          6. Log in using Imprudence Viewer
  3. Setting up Imprudence Viewer and exploring the system (~30 min)
      1. Get in groups / assign logins
      2. Don't change plants or terrain!
      3. (Except after a while let them play with the visualizations) - Pass out cheatsheet
      4. Segue into the next section by having them share their observations.
  4. Talking about fern lifecycle, Hardy-Weinberg, looking at data from our population, trying visualizations, and talking about how the simulation works (45 minutes)
      1. What kind of plants are these?
      2. What is the lifecycle of those plants?
      3. How is that different from our lifecycle?
      4. What are the assumptions of HWE?
      5. What do we expect if assumptions are met or violated?
      6. How can we get data from this simulation that tells us about HWE?
      7. Make some more observations and start listing some questions (BEFORE we mess up the sample population)
  5. Playing with changing plant parameters and planting form (forgot to include playing with terrain settings) (15 minutes) - Pass out About VPGsim
      1. What can we control?
      2. How could we use this to do experiments?
  6. Designing a class experiment and talking through what we might expect to see (30 minutes)
      1. Start with questions and hypotheses
      2. Pick one and make predictions
      3. What info will we need to test those predictions?
      4. What are our controls?
      5. Define methods.
  7. Setting up class experiment (20 minutes) - Pass out Tutorial
