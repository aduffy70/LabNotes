  * Controls:
      * Up/down arrows - forward/backward movement relative to the camera direction
      * Left/right arrows - rotate camera left right about the world vertical axis
      * E/X - rotate camera up and down
      * Z/Q - increase/decrease movement speed
      * Walk/Fly button - turns gravity on and off
      * Randomize button - generates a new randomized community of plants

    Got the basic simulation converted over and started on the visualization system.
