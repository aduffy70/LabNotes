  * Teaching iSIT summer Professional Development for Cohorts 1 & 2 at Woods Cross High.
      * Spent some time walking through an example of setting up a google group.
  * Responded to <a href="https://github.com/aduffy70/Chat-Logger/issues/2" target="_blank">Issue 2 on my OpenSim Chat-Logger module</a>.  It wasn't working on OpenSim 0.7.3.1 but compiling a new dll against that opensim release seems to have fixed it.
  * A really cool mashup of hardware and the web.  <http://www.stoneskippingrobot.com/> Use a web interface to control a robot that skips stones on a lake in Sun Valley, Idaho.  It shows it on live video stream and gives you a link to a copy of the video.  Adjust the robot's parameters to try to get more skips.
