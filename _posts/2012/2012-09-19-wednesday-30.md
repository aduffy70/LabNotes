  * Prep for Week 2 of VPGsim activity in BIOL3065
      * I am setting things up so the 3rd week is used for sharing/peer-reviewing proposals and preliminary test results.  Last year, the 3rd week was mostly wasted time.  They just shared their proposal with me and left.  Doing it this way encourages them to think through and resolve some of the problems that otherwise they wouldn't address til the final report.  It also uses the two weeks between labs as a time for running test experiments to see if what they plan will even work.
