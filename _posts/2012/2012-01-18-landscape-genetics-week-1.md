  * History of the course and introductions
  * We are using iLinc for slides shows, screen sharing, and video conference.Â  (iLinc looks cluttered, has non-intuitive controls, and the course organizers don't seem at all confident in using it)
  * Lisette Waits @ Univ of Idaho is running the course with Steve Spear handling the technology, Rodney Dyer organizing the group projects, and Melanie Murphy coordinating the group projects.
  * [Course website][1]
  * Participating in group projects is optional but could be a good way to get involved in collaborations (and each project should lead to a publication)
  * I need to be sure to thank Nancy Huntley in the Ecology Center for funding the course (send her an email later in the semester)
  * Landscape Genetics differs from population genetics in that we don't have to pre-determine the populations or groups we want to compare, we include information about the landscape in our models, and we can look at markers with adaptive significance.
