  * Renewed computer registrations on the University network using openIPAM.  Several were expiring this month so I updated everything due in the next 6 months for another year.
  * [Reading for Landscape Genetics course][1]
  * Discussion w/Paul Wolf about VPCsim conversion - don't put too much time into it, just get a mockup of the user controls and data displays.  We can demo the ScienceSim version for functionality since the teacher leaders are almost certainly going to want major changes anyway.
