  * Made fresh reagent solutions since everything was in the fridge when it failed last summer.  All per the Soltis Lab CTAB DNA extraction protocol:
      * Tris - using Tris from the big bucket (8/25/04) and HCl from the Pharmco-AAPER jug (3/16/07).  Nailed the pH8.
      * EDTA - using EDTA from the Acros Organics bottle (Feb 04) and NaOH from the brown Sigma bottle (2/27/97).  Nailed the pH8.  I made 0.5M per the instructions and remembered halfway through why we have been making 0.25M - it takes a long mixing time (over an hour) for that much EDTA to go into solution.
      * NaCl - using NaCl from Fisher (25 July 2008)
      * ddH2O for all was from the carboy cleaned and filled 5/21/10.
      * Had some problems getting the pH meter working (bad electrode error) so I could adjust the pH8 for the Tris and EDTA.  But after the probe sat in clean water for a while (the buffer(?) it was in was growing mold or had stringy precipates) I eventually got it calibrated so it read all 3 standards correctly (4, 7, 10) and my solutions are right on pH.
      * Tried using the handheld pH meter but it won’t calibrate.
      * All this took much longer than expected (due to time spend fiddling with pH meters) so I did not make TE buffer or CTAB buffer yet.

Continuing 10/31/2012

  * Mixed fresh CTAB buffer (250 mL  batch)
      * Used Tris, NaCL, and EDTA solutions from 10/30/2012
      * Used CTAB from glass jar 042386
      * Used ddH20 from 5/21/10 carboy
  * Made 70% EtOH from 200proof stock.
  * Started charging batteries for electric drill
