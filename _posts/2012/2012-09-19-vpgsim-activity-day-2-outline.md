  * Address any technology issues (so far things seem to be running more smoothly than last year)
  * Wrap-up class experiment:
      * Remind class of the experiment we set up and what we were trying to test:
          * Question- How does the terrain a population is growing on affect the levels of heterozygosity in a gene that controls response to altitude?
          * Hypothesis- Populations growing on terrains with more gradual altitude changes will have more heterozygosity because the habitat where both haplotypes can survive together will be larger.
      * Have groups summarize what happened on their assigned terrain
      * Share their summary with 2 neighboring groups and discuss
      * Each group creates a list of conclusions and questions.
      * Discuss as a class and come to conclusions and generate further questions.
  * Start group experiments:
      * Break into groups to discuss ideas for a group experiment.
          * Generate 2-3 ideas.
          * Define questions, hypotheses, and think about methods you could use to test.
      * Have each group share ideas with the class.Â  Class will probe with 2 questions (with no defense required)
      * Explain proposal assignment and peer-review requirements and expectations:
      * Let groups start developing an experiment (either one they had, or something that grew out of the group discussion).
