  * Teaching iSIT summer Professional Development for Cohorts 1 & 2 at Woods Cross High
      * Showed Cohort 2 the Diversity Database webapp.  They pointed out that having the data entry and data filter on one page is problematic because we want students to have free access to the data filter but NOT the data entry.  I need to split them and provide the teachers with two links.
  * Grabbed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mD2zL0OL5-V_oDAYkRgHup2nENQ-JrLVEYKlRyQm3to/edit" target="_blank">copy of the longer version (the version we didn't submit) of the ScienceScope manuscript</a> that I can complete and potentially use as a dissertation chapter.
