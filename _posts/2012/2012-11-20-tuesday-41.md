  * Meeting with Max Longhurst to prepare websites for iSIT fall workshop
      * Set up module 2 cohort 2 and module 4 cohort 1 sites
      * Cleaned up and made other sites more consistent with each other
      * I still need to put in experiment 1 page(s?) for module 2 and update tech tutorials to match the way we are using Google tools now
      * Max will finish module 4 site
      * Once both sites are done we need to make copies we can use as templates with future cohorts
