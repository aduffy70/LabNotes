  * Landscape Genetics reading
      * <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02927.x">doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02927.x</a> Comparison of Fst and some other measures that are standardized to avoid the 'compression' of posssible Fst values when within population diversity is high. Â This is NOT the paper I would have chosen to introduce students (many that have no population genetics background at all) to population genetics measures.
      * Allendorf, FW, G Luikart (2007) Conservation and the Genetics of Populations. Chapter 9 pp 197-227. Blackwell. (Book chapter so no DOI). This one is better but was given as 'optional' reading.
      * <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04658.x">doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04658.x</a> A practical application of Fst measures to a landscape genetics (well, seascape genetics) problem
