  * Teaching iSIT summer Professional Development for Cohorts 1 & 2 at Woods Cross High.
      * No internet access in one room. Other room computers can't run Unity Plugin (no directx 9 or video card drivers).  These computers also complained running Powerpoint!
      * There is a time limit on how quickly you can join a google group after creating a google account.  You can get around it by force adding the address to the group instead of trying to invite.  The invite emails never arrive.
