  * Are there problems logging in?  Some have reported it but Mic and I are able to log in.  Perhaps related to updated Second Life viewers since Phoenix and Imprudence don't seem to have problems.
  * No update on legal agreements... waiting on lawyers.  Mic will ping Jonathan
  * Hypergrid with Simian Grid is very close to working both directions.  Mic and Diva have been working on it.
  * Vivox voice is now enabled on Intel's regions.  May still need to be enabled at the parcel level.
