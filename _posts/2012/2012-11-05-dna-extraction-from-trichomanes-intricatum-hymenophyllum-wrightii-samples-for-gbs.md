Start with 5 samples to work out kinks in the process

Using silica dried T. intricatum and H. wrightii samples (about a dime-sized piece of each):

  * 07020 - 244mg cleaned tissue
  * 07032 - 136mg cleaned tissue
  * 07045 - 158mg cleaned tissue
  * Farrar 81-10-21-2 - 69mg cleaned tissue (this is the entire sample)
  * Stensvold 8335 - 45mg cleaned tissue

Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol.  Exceptions/notes:
  * Made 5mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc
    * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
    * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608
  * Ground using blue pestles in 1.5mL tubes, my cordless drill on high torque setting.  Held the tube in my wooden tube rack clamped to the bench in a tub of ice.
    * Applied force in an up and down bouncing and circular motion to avoid heating the plastic (it squeaks if you start to warm up).
    * Added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
    * Ground 1 minute
    * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
    * Ground 1 minute
    * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 300uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc (500uL total)
    * Ground 30 seconds
    * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle
    * Ground 30 seconds (3 minutes total)
  * Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock overnight (started 1:00pm)

Continued 11/6/12

  * Used 24:1 cloroform:isoamyl from 10/19/11
  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 15 minutes at 13000rpm in the accuSpin Micro centrifuge
  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
    * 07020: 350uL, 28uL, 204uL
    * 07032: 300uL, 24uL, 175uL
    * 07045: 350uL, 28uL, 204uL
    * Farrar 81-10-21-2: 425uL, 34uL, 248uL
    * Stensvold 8335: 350uL, 28uL, 204uL (this is bright red, while others are yellow)
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 10:30am
  * Removed from freezer at 7:30pm (9 hrs)
  * Used 70% EtOH from 2/20/08 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator

Continued 11/8/12

  * Quantified extractions using Qubit:
    * 07020 - 97.2 ng/uL
    * 07032- 144 ng/uL
    * 07045- 202 ng/uL
    * F81-10-21-2 - 44.5 ng/uL
    * 8335 - 53.8 ng/uL
