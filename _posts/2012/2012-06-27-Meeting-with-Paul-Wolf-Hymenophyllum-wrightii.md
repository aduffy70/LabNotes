  * Sent draft of Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript to Paul Wolf.
  * Met with Paul to discuss next moves:
      * Need to get 2 more committee members (Brett Shelton and Ethan White?)
      * Find out what is required to legally collect H. wrightii sporophytes in Queen Charlotte Islands.Â  Paul will be on sabbatical in the Puget Sound area next summer and might be able to take a ferry trip north.
      * Review Paul's suggestions for the H. wrightii paper, add references section and send to co-authors for input
      * See what H. wrightii DNA I have (or could get) in sufficient quantities for GBS.
