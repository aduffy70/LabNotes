  * The last of the extractions from my dry material (still more live tissue extractions and Farrar dry tissue extractions)
      * 07046 – 12mg cleaned
      * 07044 – 12mg cleaned
      * 07008 – 17mg cleaned
      * 07030 – 10mg cleaned
      * 07031 – 115mg cleaned

Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol.  Exceptions/notes:

  * Made 5mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc
      * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
      * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608

  * Ground using blue pestles in 1.5mL tubes, my cordless drill on high torque setting.  Held the tube in my wooden tube rack clamped to the bench in a tub of ice.
      * Applied force in an up and down bouncing and circular motion to avoid heating the plastic (it squeaks if you start to warm up).
      * Added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 2 minutes (less tissue so I am trying to maximize yield by grinding longer)
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 1 minute 30 seconds
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 300uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc (500uL total)
      * Ground 1 minute (4 min 30 sec total)
  * Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock overnight (started 10:00-11:00am - had to recharge the drill battery after the first 3 samples)

Continued 11/20/12

  * Used 24:1 cloroform:isoamyl from 10/19/11

  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 15 minutes at 13000rpm in the accuSpin Micro centrifuge

  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
      * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 350uL, 28uL, 204uL
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 9:00am
  * Removed from freezer at 6:00pm (9 hrs)
  * Used 70% EtOH from 2/20/08 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator
