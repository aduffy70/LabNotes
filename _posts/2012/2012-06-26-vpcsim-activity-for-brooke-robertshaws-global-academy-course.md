<a href="http://globalengagement.usu.edu/htm/education/immersion" target="_blank">Background on Global Academy</a>

Wednesday Jun 27, 1-3pm in YETC (room 170 of the Emma Eccles Jones Building)

Since we have limited time and no opportunity for homework, we will just do two rounds of inquiry.

Created a <a href="http://vpcsim.usu.edu/globalacademy" target="_blank">'go to' page</a> for the class with links to the simulator and to the class and group experiment sheets.

Set permissions on the experiment sheets (in Google Docs) so that anyone with the link can edit.  This avoids having to worry about whether students have Google Docs accounts.

Basic lesson plan based on the iSIT module 3:

  * Intro
      * Learning science as a process rather than facts
      * Outline plan for 2  experiments
      * Advantages of simulations
      * VPCsim
  * Guided exploration
      * Free time
      * Sharing
          * Moving through space and time
          * Getting info about the community
          * Changing the environment and species in the community
      * Model setting up an experiment
  * Experiment 1
      * Talk about research question and hypothesis
      * Discuss methods
          * Assign water levels
      * Run simulations and collect data
      * Conclusions
          * Group conclusions based on their subset of the data
          * Class conclusions based on full dataset
      * Search for info on the web to help understand our results and conclusions
  * Experiment 2
      * Review simulation features
      * Talk about general research question
      * Generate list of hypotheses
      * Experimental design
          * Groups pick hypothesis and design experiment
              * What comparisons?
              * What is the same?
              * What is different?
              * What data to record?
          * Share and critique designs
          * Finalize designs
      * Run simulations, collect data, and draw conclusions
      * Share results and peer review of conclusions
