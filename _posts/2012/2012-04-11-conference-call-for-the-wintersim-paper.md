Attending: Mic Bowman, Kitty Liu (works with Mic), Jerry Talton (works with Mic), Warren Hunt (works in a different group at Intel, concerned with algorithms and generalizing problems)

  * I need to send out links to my project description and anything else I have written up on my project.Â  Perhaps a flow chart or diagram showing what I had to build in order to make my system work - to show the parts that could be incorporated into more generic domain specific libraries vs what is specific to my organisms.
  * My work characterizes the problem (to do anything meaningful with VE's you have to build a lot of 'stuff' on top of the base platform and doing this is expensive) but also shows why it could be valuable to solve this problem (my tools have both research and educational applications and teachers find them useful and valuable).
  * Kitty will prepare an outline and assign portions for individual writers.
