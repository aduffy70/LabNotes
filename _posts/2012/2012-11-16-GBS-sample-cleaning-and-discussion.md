  * Cleaning Trichomanes intricatum tissue to extract DNA for GBS.  Finished last of the ones I will use my silica dried tissue for.  The rest will be from fresh tissue or Farrar dry tissue.  I will extract these 5 and then start on fresh tissue.  Since I have a bit less cleaned tissue for some of these than last time, I will grind a bit longer to try to maximize yields.
  * Talked to Paul about GBS vs Rad Tags.  I need to determine which is better suited to organisms with large genomes.  Even if we do end up using GBS we will need to add a couple nucleotides to the adapters to try to further limit the number of different sequences we are including.  With a big genome the chances of getting the same stacks from all samples is just too small unless we limit things somehow.
