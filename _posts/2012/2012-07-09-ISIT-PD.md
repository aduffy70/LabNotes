  * Final preparation for the iSIT summer professional development for cohorts 1 & 2.
      * Created websites based on last year's module 1 site (for module 1) and on the module 2 site (for module 3).
      * Created a new google group for cohort 2 (isitpd2@googlegroups.com)
      * Created class logins for both cohorts (isitcohort1@gmail.com & isitcohort2@gmail.com).Â  We only really need the class login for cohort 2 but just in case...
      * Linked the new websites to the main iSIT site at isit.usu.edu
      * Rewrote tutorials to adjust for students not being able to use Google Sites directly.
