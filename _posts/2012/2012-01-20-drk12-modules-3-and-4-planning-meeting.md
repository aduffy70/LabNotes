  * Module 3 VPCsim activity needs to focus on Standard 2 Objective 2
  * Can we start out using plants that students are familiar with but in the final round switch to made-up plants with similar characteristics as a way of testing students' ability to transfer knowledge from the known to unknown?
  * Keep the simulation as open and flexible as possible without overwhelming the students with too many unnecessary choices.
  * For the Mar 6th meeting w/Teacher Leaders be prepared to demonstrate what we have today and get their input on how they might use it in the classroom. Â We want their input but don't let them force a total redesign - keep the basic concept.
