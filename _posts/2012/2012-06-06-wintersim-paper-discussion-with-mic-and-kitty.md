By TONIGHT:Â  Replace the current text on how to generalize my modules.

2 prong approach:

  1. For the parameters module how would I use the new modInvoke tools to generalize the module?
  2. For the entire system how would I rearchitecture it now that these tools are available to make a general genetic simulation system with objects that drop into an area and don't require a shitload of lsl scripting to simulate reproduction and interaction with each other and their environment.
