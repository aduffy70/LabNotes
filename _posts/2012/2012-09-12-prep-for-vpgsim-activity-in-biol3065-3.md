  * Tests of regions are going well.Â  Can be checked quickly (updates every 10 minutes) at [ http://129.123.16.10/top ]( http://129.123.16.10/top )
  * Printed resource sheets (VPGsim Tutorial, About VPGsim, Intro to ScienceSim & VPGsim and the Cheatsheet, each on their own).
  * Printed a group contact info signup sheet so I don't have to wait for groups to contact me first.
  * Printed pre-assessments (we can't use them for research, but it might be interesting to see)
  * Bought 2 thumbdrives and put Imprudence Viewer downloads for all three platforms on them.
  * Printed out password/login info and cut up.
  * Restarted all regions and started sample pops in all regions:

    ~~~
    /15 1347475901
    /18 4
    /4 0000000000,0,256,128,256,200,1
    /4 1111111111,0,256,0,128,200,1
    /3 reset
    /3 start
    ~~~

  * (default parameters, 25 small islands, 200 all recessive sporophytes in the north half, 200 all dominant sporophytes in the south half, cleared logs/plots, started logging/plotting).
  * Still need to, setup backup regions and get pc's from Max Longhurst.
