  Todd Campbell and Max Longhurst asked me about the possibility of changing module 1 to use VPCsim (or something like it) instead of a field activity.  They want to know if we could modify VPCsim do the same sort of high/low human impact comparison we do in the field.  VPCsim already has a human impact setting built in so it is possible, but I don't think that part of the simulation is rich enough to produce anything but obviously fixed result.  Changing the human impact affects all plants equally and all it does is increase their death rates.  I think if we were to do this the relationships in the simulation would need to be a bit more complex.
