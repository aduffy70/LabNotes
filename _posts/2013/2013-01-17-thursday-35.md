  * Revised maps for Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript.
      * Changed the symbols used for different sites - closed triangles for 2006/2008 survey sites, open triangles for survey sites where we didn't find anything, closed squares for pre-1980 sites
      * Judith Harpel confirmed that the Sonora Island, Hall Point collection IS indeed H. wrightii.  That is interesting because it is the only site east of the rainshadow of Vancouver Island, though it is far enough north that perhaps moisture is funneled down the nearly east-west passage leading to the sea?
      * Added a QCI map showing the reported pre-1980 gametophyte locations on the islands and near Prince Rupert.  Didn't show sporophytes because the focus of this paper is the gametophytes.
      * I was able to identify nearly all of the UBC collections as gametophyte or sporophyte by crossreferencing Mary Stensvold's sporophyte photos of herbarium sheets and the collection numbers in the literature reporting gametophytes and sporophytes.  The only 2(?) where I had any doubt were collections with descriptions matching the reported sporophyte sites on QCI, so they are almost certainly sporophytes and not really new locations even if they are gametophytes.
  * Worked on manuscript text to adjust for the new figures and figure numbers.
