Extracting Trichomanes intricatum gametophyte samples from Don Farrar.  Also includes some Trichomanes boschianum sporophytes and gametophytes that might be T. intricatum or T. boschianum.  There are more.  This is just the first batch.

  * F81-9-22-17 - 71mg
  * F81-9-26-1 - 38mg
  * F81-9-26-5 - 4mg
  * F81-10-10-1 - 2mg
  * F81-10-12-2 - 5mg
  * F82-4-29-4 (sporophyte) - 8mg
  * F1998-1 - 77mg
  * F2002-1 - 4mg

Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol.  Exceptions/notes:

Mixed fresh CTAB buffer (250 mL  batch)

  * Used Tris, NaCL, and EDTA solutions from 10/30/2012
  * Used CTAB from glass jar 042386
  * Used ddH2O from DNAse free stock 327390010 (because all of our ddH2O is over 3 years old)

Made 10mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc

  * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
  * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608

Ground using blue pestles in 1.5mL tubes, my cordless drill on high torque setting.  Held the tube in my wooden tube rack clamped to the bench in a tub of ice.

  * Applied force in an up and down bouncing and circular motion to avoid heating the plastic (it squeaks if you start to warm up).
  * Added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
  * Ground 2 minutes (less tissue so I am trying to maximize yield by grinding longer)
  * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
  * Ground 2 minutes
  * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 300uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc (500uL total)
  * Ground 1 minute (5 min total)
  * Note - the battery only lasts long enough to do about 5 samples.  The backup battery barely holds a charge anymore.
  * Note - on the bigger samples I started with 200uL buffer, then another 100, then 200. Otherwise they just get gummed up.
  * Note - I think the tube for F81-10-10-1 split during grinding and it pulled in water from the ice bath.  There shouldn't be any plant DNA contaminants in the bath water, so I transferred it to a new tube and will continue to process it.  But the volume will be greater because of this.

Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock overnight (started between 11:30am and 2:30pm.)

Continued 10/8/13

  * Used 24:1 cloroform:isoamyl from 10/19/11
  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 20 minutes at 13000rpm in the accuSpin Micro centrifuge
  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
    * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 375uL, 30uL, 219uL
    * Except F81-10-10-1: 500uL, 40uL, 292uL
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 10:30am

Continued 10/9/13

  * Removed from freezer at 8:00am (21.5 hrs)
  * Used 70% EtOH from 10/31/12 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator

Not seeing much of a pellet in most...
