  * I set up Max and Todd as site admins and showed them how to edit content
  * Basic site design and layout are fine
  * Todd and Max started editing the text on the various pages and are set to continue this.
  * I need to clean up the sidebar logos so their bounding boxes are the same size
  * Don't add NYIT logo.  We will link to them in the text of the About box
  * Front page:
      * The basic idea of a bit of text, and the tri-color blocks about the constructs is fine, but I need to change how it is set up so the text in the color blocks can be edited (currently just an image).
      * I need to add a second graphic to the front page with 4 blocks in a square and the three constructs in the center and arrows cycling around them. Each block is for a module and contains a sentence about the module and links to the module description page, and some immediately engaging content.  Next to each block place a couple words about the ICT's that tie it to the NYIT project.
          * Module 1 (Database & Google Docs): the database or a photo gallery
          * Module 2 (Video creation): A splice video
          * Module 3 (3D simulations): VPCsim
          * Module 4 (???): S'cape
  * We discussed the use of photos on the site and decided it is best to avoid using photos we have of students (even if they can't be identified).  Use stock photos if we need shots with kids.  Photos of the project leaders are fine.
  * Discussed possible creating short (2-3 minute) videos for each module - possibly to be used as the 'immediately engaging content' on the front page.
  * I need to edit the header image on the front page so the title fits into white space.
