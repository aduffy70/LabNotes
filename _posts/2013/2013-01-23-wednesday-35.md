  * Don Farrar is ok with submitting the current Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript draft.  Mary Stensvold had a few additional comments, so:
      * I revised the SE Alaska map to make the pre-1980 sites not be hidden by 2006 sites, and added 2 additional locations.
      * Added Haida Gwaii sporophyte locations to the map.  There are several that have the same vague location descriptions so I only put a single symbol for each general location.  In most cases the lat/long data in the UBC database is not precise - the collections for the north end of Dawson Inlet use the lat/long for the center of the inlet and the collection at the east end of Mercer Lake uses the center of the lake - so I tried to place the symbols in locations that fit the location descriptions.
