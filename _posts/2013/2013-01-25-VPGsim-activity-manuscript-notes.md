  * Started the manuscript for the VPGsim activity chapter of my dissertation.  Used the IRB proposal as a starting point and reworked the text into an intro and beginning of a methods section.  No results or discussion yet, obviously.
  * A first look at the VPGsim Attitudes about science data... if I convert the Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Don't Know, Agree, Strongly Disagree ratings into numbers (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) the average ratings for each question definitely increase from the pre to post surveys.  Don't know if it is statistically significant increase, but they all DO increase.
