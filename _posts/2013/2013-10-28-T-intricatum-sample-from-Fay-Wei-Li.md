  * Paul Wolf sent me a live Trichomanes intricatum sample collected by Fay-Wei Li earlier this month at Dry Falls, NC.  It is not vouchered and this sample is all he had, but I can include it in my GBS study.  I labeled it as Li 2013-1.  I'll keep it alive until I extract, then silica dry what is left for a voucher.  I also have a 1960's sample from this location collected by Don Farrar.
