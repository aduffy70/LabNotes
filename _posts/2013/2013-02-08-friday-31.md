  * Convert Module 3 & 4 images to publication-quality format and sent to Todd Campbell.  We lose a bit of image quality in the conversion because they are all 72 dpi screenshots and we have to make them 300 dpi.  This shrinks them way down in physical size so I scale them up which makes them a bit fuzzy.  Moved them all to the shared DRK12 folder in Dropbox in a subfolder called Module3And5ManuscriptImages.
