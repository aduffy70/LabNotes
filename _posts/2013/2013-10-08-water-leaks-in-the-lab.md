title: Water leaks in the lab

We have 2 leaks:

  1. The ice machine leaks and has for as long as I have been here. It drains to the floor and a pump is supposed to suck up the water and raise it to a drain.  This is flaky and there is often a puddle under or in front of the machine.
  2. There is a leak on the south side at the end of the first row of benches.  It was running down into the wall and under the benches.  The water on the floor extended out to the water from the ice machine so it looked like all one problem, so facilities shut off the icemachine.  Even when the machine was dry there was still water at the other end of the room so I asked Brian Joy to call facilities.  They were here working on it yesterday and today.

I think we can turn on the icemachine again since it was not the cause of the unusual amount of water on the floor, but it would be nice if we could get a pan below where it drains.  I need to look into this.  Also Scott Bernhardt says he has been talking to Nancy Kay about having the department pay for repairs so I will wait and see if they are already working on having someone come look at it.

Discussed this with Paul Wolf this morning.

Update 10/11/13:

We got the secondary leak on the south side fixed (a leaky backflow in the ceiling) so I turned the ice machine back on.  There is definitely something wrong with it in addition to the normal dripping on the floor.  Water ran down the side, streamed continually out of the drain hose, and even when the power was off I could hear water flowing.  I turned it back of, shut off the water supply and I will discuss with Scott.
