  * Earlier this week I moved gemmae from the nook by the desks to the computer bench with cordate and plastid.  I didn't want it near where the plumbers were going to be working and this also put it where I could plug into the UPS.  The only server in the lab not on the UPS is cordate (the one that needs it most) but I don't want to shut down cordate during school hours since students may be using VPCsim.
