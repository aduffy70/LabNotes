  * Max Longhurst called to ask if I would be willing to take a 'brain-dump' from Dave (Monoa?) who has been working on the data collection backend for S'cape.  They don't want me to do anything with it yet, but at some point in the future we may want to find a way to utilize that data and we need someone on the project who understands how it is set up.  It will just be 3-4 hours and no additional work in the short-term, and he already passed it by Paul Wolf, so I agreed.  Brett Shelton will be scheduling a meeting with me, Dave, and Jeff Olsen.
