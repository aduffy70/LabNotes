  * Got the data for UBC herbarium collections of Hymenophyllum wrightii, figured out which were actually sporophytes (by crossreferencing with the published collections and Mary Stensvold's photos from 2008.
  * Mary found out from Judith Harpel at UBC herbarium that the Schofield collection from Spirit Park in Vancouver is misidentified - it is a liverwort.  That makes more sense based on what we know about H. wrightii - Vancouver seemed like it would be too dry in the rainshadow of Vancouver Island.  That leaves one seeming oddball- the Hall Point, Sonora Island collection (UBC V157322).  It is also east of Vancouver Island where we wouldn't expect H. wrightii.  Mary asked Judy to take a look at that sample too.  I need to add Judy Harpel to the acknowledgments section of the paper.
