1. Talk to Zach Gompert about maximizing locus overlap on Trichomanes intricatum GBS.  Because of potential problems with unknown ploidy levels and multiple individuals in each DNA sample I need to be sure that I have HIGH coverage and a few loci rather than low coverage at many loci.
2. Check on AFJ paper.  Do they have what they need or are they waiting on me?
3. QCI trip... this month or spring?
4. Start gametophytes for Josh's Pteridium (the one he used for his RNA work) and a sampling of other species.  We want to get low coverage genome data for several species so we can see which have the smallest genomes with the least repeat structure so we can make a good argument for what species should be the first fern genome sequenced.
5. S48 extraction & send DNA to Paul.  Finish cleaning the DNA on EtOH in the freezer stocks or run a new extraction from greenhouse tissue.
6. Make progress on VPGsim genetics lab paper for next meeting.
