  * Updated Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript with latest comments from Mary Stensvold and Don Farrar.
  * Mary points out that our paper is trying to describe the known extents of H. wrightii gametophytes but we are ignoring the additional British Columbia sites with collections in UBC herbarium.  We need to add an additional map of these sites to the paper.  One of them is a park in Vancouver (though she has contacted the herbarium to see if there is a possibility this is a coding error - she is also trying to get a picture of this sheet so we can verify its identity) which provides support for the idea that there could be additional sites in the Puget Sound area.
  * Tried to get data for H. wrightii collections at UBC herbarium and the Royal BC museum.  The 5 collections in the museum appear to be sporophyte collections from the Graham Island sites in the Queen Charlottes, so they aren't important to the manuscript.  I can't get the [vascular plants search link][1] for the herbarium to open
