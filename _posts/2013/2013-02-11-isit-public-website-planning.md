Notes from conversation with Max Longhurst:

  * Example of what they want: <a href="http://tools4teachingscience.org/" target="_blank">http://tools4teachingscience.org/</a>
  * Target audience is someone who knows nothing about the project.  It should tell them what we are trying to do in the project and how we can provide support for others
  * Need icons for NSF, USU, and UMassDartmouth
  * Main page: a 3 column table with sections for New Literacies, Science Literacies, and ICTs and a short sentence about each.  Highly visual and colorful
  * Sidebar links to sections on:
      * Findings
      * Publications & Presentations
      * Learning Modules (with a page for each of the 4 modules)
      * People (with professional bio's for the team)
  * URL: cyberlearning.usu.edu (submitted cname request to point this to gemmae.  We need a long-term hosting solution....)
