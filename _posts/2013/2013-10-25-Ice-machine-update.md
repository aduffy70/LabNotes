Worked on the ice machine and sent a summary to Scott Bernhardt and Nancy Kay Harrison. Here is an update on the ice machine flooding situation in BNR 46...

The problems:

  1. The drainpipes leading into the wall were leaking.
  2. The valve in the machine that controls the water supply is broken so water flows continuously.  Extra water should go to the drain, but because the tubing was plugged it was overflowing onto the floor.
  3. A separate pump behind the machine that collects water from melting ice is not working so that water was overflowing onto the floor.  The pump was completely plugged with hard water deposits.

The solutions:

  1. Someone from facilities came yesterday and fixed the leaking drainpipes.
  2. I cleared the hard water deposits from all the tubing in the machine.  Now the extra water flows to the drain instead of onto the floor.  To stop the extra water I need a replacement valve (Mfr: HOSHIZAKI Pt #: 4A0865-01, available online for around $45).
  3. The pump is damaged beyond repair so I need a replacement (Little Giant Pump Co. VCMA-15ULST, available online for $35-$60).

Long-term we need a preventative maintenance plan for this machine, because hard water deposits will be an ongoing problem. The person I talked to from facilities says we should be able to have the HVAC people on campus flush the lines annually.

I can order and install these two parts, and I assume that finding an account where we can cover around $100 won't be a problem, but I don't know how to setting up billing for new suppliers - I've only ever placed orders with places like Fisher and Sigma where we had established accounts.  Who do I need to talk to to do this
