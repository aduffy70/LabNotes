  * Github cleanup.
      * I need to combine my non-vpgsim Opensim region modules into a single repo that is clearly marked as reference only.  I can't continue to support this code.
      * Added license (BSD) and contributors files to VPCsim-Unity and moved the repo from private to public.  There is no reason to hide this code.
      * Need to combine (and consider renaming?) my asstools in a single repo.
      * Combine and clearly identify as archived the repos for the Opensim version of vpcsim (vMeadow).
      * This will get me down to 11 repos - 10 public
