  * Cleaning Trichomanes intricatum samples for DNA extraction and GBS.
  * Updated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkDnkQIRAeIIdHg5YUwtZ2dSeXVxeUlNUzh1bGZsNFE#gid=0" target="_blank">sheet tracking which areas I have cleaned/extracted tissue for</a>.  I now have cleaned tissue for all areas where I have at least one sample large enough to be worth trying.  Back to extractions tomorrow!  The battery is on the charger for the drill, but I need to bring my plug in drill to see if it will work for grinding.  Also want to try double grinding (before and after the 55 degree incubation step) and ginding with a pinch of sand.
