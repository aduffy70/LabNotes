Extracting Trichomanes intricatum gametophyte samples mine and Don Farrar's).  Also includes some Trichomanes boschianum sporophytes and gametophytes that might be T. intricatum or T. boschianum.  There are more.  This is just the third batch.

Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol.  Exceptions/notes:

  * Made 10mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc
      * Use CTAB buffer from 10/7/13
      * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
      * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608
  * Ground using blue pestles in 1.5mL tubes, my plugin drill (to avoid battery limitations.  It spins faster but works fine.).  Held the tube in my wooden tube rack clamped to the bench in a tub of ice.
      * Applied force in an up and down bouncing and circular motion to avoid heating the plastic (it squeaks if you start to warm up).
      * Added 200uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 100 strokes
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 200uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 100 strokes
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc (500uL total)
      * Ground 100 strokes
  * Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock overnight (started between 11:30am and 1:30pm)

Continued 11/19/13

  * Used 24:1 cloroform:isoamyl from 10/19/11 til it ran out then made more using chloroform from Pfrender 05/08 and isoamyl from Pfrender 02/02.
  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 20 minutes at 13000rpm in the accuSpin Micro centrifuge
  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
      * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 250uL, 20uL, 146uL
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 11:45am
  * All these volumes were low... due to the sand?  To be safe, I am doing a double extraction:
      * Added 300uL fresh CTAB+PVP+Bmerc to the chloroform and debris layers of each tube and vortexed.
      * Incubated 1 hour at 55C
      * Added another 150uL chloroform:isoamyl (300 would have been too much for the tubes in most cases, plus the chloroform is all still in the tubes from before, right?
      * mixed by shaking and spun 15 minutes at 13000rpm
      *  Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot)
          * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 300uL, 24uL, 175uL
          * Added this additional aqueous layer, AmAcet and isoproponal to the same sample tubes already in the freezer.
          * Placed back in the freezer at 1:45pm
          * <em id="__mceDel">F8-19-76-3 didn't have an aqueous layer either time.  not sure what happened. There was no clear debris layer either, just sand at the bottom.</em>

Continued 11/20/13

  * Removed from freezer at 9:00am
  * Used 70% EtOH from 10/31/12 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator

Large visible pellets in all
