  * Changed VPGsim and VPCsim signs in ScienceSim to link to the webpages on aduffy70.org instead of giving a landmark since I no longer have demos running.
  * Looked into setting up Grails on crozier (so I can take over the S'cape database stuff from Dave Manoa.  It doesn't look like it is supported for Ubuntu Lucid so I will need to upgrade.  (I have to upgrade by April anyway since Ubuntu Lucid is approaching the end of its support cycle)
