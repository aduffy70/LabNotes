  * Impromptu meeting over coffee with Paul Wolf, Martin Schilling, and Hardeep Rai to discuss BGS vs RAD-seq.  The two processes are so similar I'm still not sure I understand the difference.  We are meeting again next tuesday.  I suggested everyone take another look at the Davey et al paper I read last week since the biases it discusses may be relevant to the data filtering we are doing. Emailed the group another copy (Karen Mock originally distributed it to all of us).
