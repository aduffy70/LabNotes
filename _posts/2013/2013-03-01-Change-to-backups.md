  * Monthly backups - added cyberlearning.usu.edu database and files to the list of things to backup on crozier.Â  Had to change the way I backup Google Docs: there is no longer a button to download items because they now have a Google Drive app that syncs the files on your computer like Dropbox does, so I now backup Google Drive and Dropbox the same way.
