  * Started gathering chemicals to make Bolds nutrient medium for growing gametophytes.  A couple of the chemicals were borrowed from the Pfrender lab last time I made this and may have to be tracked down elsewhere.  Unfortunately all the stocks I made last time were in the big glass fridge when it failed.
  * Helped Martin Schilling set up a wordpress site for his lab notes.  He now has a user account on gemmae and http://seedfree.usu.edu points to his site.
  * Plumber came to fix the leak on the south side of the room
