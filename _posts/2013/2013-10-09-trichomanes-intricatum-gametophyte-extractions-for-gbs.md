Extracting Trichomanes intricatum gametophyte samples from Don Farrar.  Also includes some Trichomanes boschianum sporophytes and gametophytes that might be T. intricatum or T. boschianum.  There are more.  This is just the second batch.

  * F2006-1  -  35mg
  * F2006-2  -  28mg
  * F2006-3  -  2mg
  * F82-4-28-8  -  44mg
  * F82-3-12-7  -  30mg
  * F82-3-12-5  -  15mg

Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol.  Exceptions/notes:

  * Made 10mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc
      * Use CTAB buffer from 10/7/13
      * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
      * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608
  * Ground using blue pestles in 1.5mL tubes, my cordless drill on high torque setting.  Held the tube in my wooden tube rack clamped to the bench in a tub of ice.
      * Applied force in an up and down bouncing and circular motion to avoid heating the plastic (it squeaks if you start to warm up).
      * Added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 2 minutes (less tissue so I am trying to maximize yield by grinding longer)
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 2 minutes
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 300uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc (500uL total)
      * Ground 1 minute (5 min total)
      * Note – ground 4, did other things for 20 minutes while the battery charged and then the last 2.
      * Note – on the bigger samples I started with 200uL buffer, then another 100, then 200. Otherwise they just get gummed up.
  * Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock overnight (started between 1:30pm and 2:30    )

Continued 10/10/13

  * Used 24:1 cloroform:isoamyl from 10/19/11
  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 20 minutes at 13000rpm in the accuSpin Micro centrifuge
  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
      * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 375uL, 30uL, 219uL
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 11:30am

Continued 10/11/13

  * Removed from freezer at 10:00am (22.5 hrs)
  * Used 70% EtOH from 10/31/12 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator

Better pellets this time.  A couple really large.
