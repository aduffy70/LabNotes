  * Upgraded this wordpress site, and my unofficial site
  * Stream-lined and organized my online presence:
      * When I started:
          * aduffy70.org - synonym for aduffy70.usu.edu
          * aduffy70.usu.edu - wordpress site (at /public) with my blog (obsolete), research page, coding page and contact page
          * fernseed.usu.edu - synonym for virtualbiology.usu.edu and home of a bunch of little cgi script tools
          * virtualbiology.usu.edu - drupal site w/info for vpcsim and vpgsim. Also home to the vpgsim webforms
          * vpgsim.usu.edu - html site with links and documents for VPGsim activity
          * vpcsim.usu.edu - html site for vpcsim system
          * seedfree.usu.edu - wordpress site for this elab notebook
      * And now:
          * aduffy70.org - wordpress site for my unofficial online presence w/research, coding, and contact pages and descriptions of vpgsim and vpcsim
          * elab.aduffy70.org - wordpress site for this elab notebook
          * fernseed.usu.edu - html page with links to the ConwayGOL form, iSIT ramp height calculator, and CSV to KML batch converter.  Any direct links to those tools that people are using (iSIT teachers for example) still work.
          * vpgsim.usu.edu - html site with links and documents for VPGsim activity, including the webforms (the student/user page).  I still need to update things within the VPGsim system to point to the new location of these forms.
          * vpcsim.usu.edu - html site for vpcsim system (the student/user page)
          * Obsolete cnames all forward to aduffy70.org:
              * aduffy70.usu.edu
              * virtualbiology.usu.edu - I completely eliminated the drupal site
              * seedfree.usu.edu
