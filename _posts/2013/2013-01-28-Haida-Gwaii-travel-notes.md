  * What would it take to collect Hymenophyllum wrightii in Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands)?
      * The most easily accessible Dawson inlet, Tanu Bay, and Vans Inlet sites are all located in the [Daawuuxusda Conservancy][1] (pronounced Daaw hhusta), which is jointly managed by BC Parks and the Haida Nation. [Map][2]
      * Other less accessible sites are located in the Krajina Ecological Preserve and I can't tell who manages the site at the Tasu townsite.
      * [According to BC Parks website][3], no Park Use Permit is required for scientific research in BC Parks lands provided <10 specimens of yellow-listed plants are removed. Notification to BC Parks is still required - they have to be the ones to decide that no permit is required - and they may issue letters of permission.
      * H. wrightii is yellow-listed according to the [British Columbia Species and Ecosystem Explorer database][4]
      * What about export/import requirements to bring the collections into the US? If this is a problem, could I make arrangements to do extractions at UBC and deposit the specimens so I only bring DNA over the border?
      * Travel:
          * Travel to Haida Gwaii by ferry requires taking the Alaska Marine Highway from Bellingham, WA to Ketchikan, AK, a second AMH ferry from Ketchikan to Prince Rupert BC, and then BC Ferries from Prince Rupert to Skidegate.  Or you can take a Grayhound bus from Vancouver, over the ferry to Vancouver Island and up to Port Hardy, then catch the BC Ferries to Prince Rupert and finally Skidegate.  Flying to Prince Rupert is simpler and doesn't cost any more than the ferry or bus/ferry once you include the cost of getting to/from Bellingham or Vancouver. ~$1100 round trip -- all this assumes travel without a car - taking a car on the ferry drastically increases costs and the car won't be useful to get to the sporophyte sites on Haida Gwaii anyway.
          * Getting to Haida Gwaii is not trivial but getting from Skidegate or Queen Charlotte to the sporophyte sites will likely be more difficult - the last 25 miles will likely be as expensive as the rest of the trip.
              * There are water taxi services but they only advertise regular services to the national park areas on the east coast of the islands - the west coast is not a popular destination.  Charter fishing services advertise trips through the Skidegate narrows toward the west coast, so that may be an option - though likely expensive.  The water taxi services charge ~$300/person to drop off and then pick up kayaking groups in the areas they normally serve.
              * There are gravel roads to a small section of the coast west of Yakoun lake but this is not an area where sporophytes have been collected and road likely mean the area has been logged. Car rentals, land taxi services and auto tours are available.
