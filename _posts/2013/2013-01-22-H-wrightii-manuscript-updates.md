  * Finished(?) revising the Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript and sent it off for review by Don Farrar and Mary Stensvold.  Told them I would like to submit by week's end if possible.  In this version I have changed the following:
      * Referred to QCI by the correct name (Haida Gwaii) - Mary's suggestion
      * Referred to Trichomanes intricatum as Crepidomanes intricatum - Don's suggestion
      * Moved city labels on the map to (hopefully) make it more clear that the open circles represent towns - Don's
      * Added the idea of average conditions rather than single-events as habitat limitations to the discussion - Don's
      * Updated the title - Don's
      * Incorporated Mary's wording changes and grammatical improvements - Mary's
      * Included info from UBC herbarium on additional collections after the first H. wrightii reports (including a map of the gametophyte collections in Haida Gwaii and around Prince Rupert - Mary's
