  * At Paul Wolf and Josh Der's request, looked for Pteridium aquilinum DNAs we can use for whole genome sequencing or GBS type things:
      * All of the Pteridium DNA we have left from the TeamCP project went through the chloroplast extraction process - some cleaned with EtOH and Quiagen kits, and some with CsCl
      * In Josh's bracken stocks we have many different extractions but it looks like there are several tubes of Wolf 921.
      * I was hoping to find S48, since I think that is what we used for the chloroplast gene order work and so it should be vouchered.  The stocks I was working from for that project are gone, but I did find two tubes of S48 in the Fern DNA on EtOH box.  I could finish the EtOH cleaning on those and quantify if we want to use those.
  * Paul wants me to go ahead and finish the EtOH cleaning on the S48 when I do other extractions
