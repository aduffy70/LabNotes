  * Combined all my non-VPGsim opensim modules and associated webapps into a single repository on github.  This cleans things up considerably and puts less emphasis on my non-work-related opensim projects.
  * Combined my notepad and tasklist webapps into a single repository on github.
  * Open-sourced the PECS repository.  My student waiver on github expires this month and I will no longer be able to keep private repos for free.  This repo is no more or less sensitive than the gbs code that we are developing in a public repo.
