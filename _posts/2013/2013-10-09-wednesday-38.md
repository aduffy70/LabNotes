  * Continued Trichomanes intricatum extractions and started a new batch.
  * Setup Martin Schilling with a new PCR kit and helped with a PCR.  Shared my PCR template on Google Drive with Martin.
  * Added a link from this elab to my protocols on Google Drive. Only one there but I need to get the rest transferred.
  * Shared my Qubit protocol on Google Drive with Martin.
  * Continued gathering chemicals for Bold nutrient solution... still need to find (and don't have in the Wolf lab):
      * Sodium nitrate NaNO<sub>3</sub>
      * Dipotassium phosphate K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
      * Sulfuric acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
      * Cobalt chloride CoCl<sub>2</sub>
      * Sodium molybdate Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> * 2H<sub>2</sub>O
  * Earlier this week I moved gemmae from the nook by the desks to the computer bench with cordate and plastid.  I didn't want it near where the plumbers were going to be working and this also put it where I could plug into the UPS.  The only server in the lab not on the UPS is cordate (the one that needs it most) but I don't want to shut down cordate during school hours since students may be using VPCsim.
