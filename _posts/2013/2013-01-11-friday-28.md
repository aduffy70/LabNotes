  * Renewed all my devices registered on USU's network (through IPAM).  Several were expiring next week, but I renewed all so they will be on the same schedule and I won't have to worry about them again til January 2014.

      * <http://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evr089> Apparently anciently asexual arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have retained their core meiotic genes, suggesting cryptic sex.  We know the genes involved in the meiotic pathway of landplants.  So, we could look for these genes in independent fern gametophytes and closely related sexual fern gametophytes to see if they are retained and whether selection has been relaxed in the independent fern gametophytes (as we'd expect if these genes were no longer being used).
