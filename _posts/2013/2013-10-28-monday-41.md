  * Helped Martin Schilling with his first CTAB DNA extraction.
  * Created a google docs version of the CTAB DNA extraction protocol and shared w/Martin.
  * Paul Wolf sent me a live Trichomanes intricatum sample collected by Fay-Wei Li earlier this month at Dry Falls, NC.  It is not vouchered and this sample is all he had, but I can include it in my GBS study.  I labeled it as Li 2013-1.  I'll keep it alive until I extract, then silica dry what is left for a voucher.  I also have a 1960's sample from this location collected by Don Farrar.
  * Cleaned T. intricatum tissue in preparation for DNA extraction for GBS.
  * Checked with Katie Weglarz in the von Dohlen lab to see if they have any of the chemicals I still need for Bolds nutrient medium.  They don't but she recommended talking to the Savitsky lab.
  * Used bleach to clean out the cabinet next to where the leak in the ceiling was and put the rest of the stuff cluttering the workbench back where it belongs.  It still smells a little musty in here but not as bad as it was.
