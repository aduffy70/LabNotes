# Problem

We assume that filamentous gametophytes are too simple to identify them to species based on morphology. The North American gametophytes have a lot of variability but until now we haven't had many samples clearly identified to species using DNA so we couldn't tell how much of that variability is within species or how much might represent differences between species.

# Hypothesis

By closely inspecting samples positively identified to species using DNA (Crepidomanes intricatum, Vandenboschia boschiana, and Didymoglossum petersii) I may be able to find characters that differentiate them.

# Plan

In my C. intricatum GBS analysis I identified xxx DNA samples I am confident are V. boschiana, xxx I am confident are D. petersii, and xxx I am confident are C. intricatum. Find the remaining collection tissue corresponding to those samples and inspect it closely.

Traits to consider:
  * cell size, length, width, length:width ratio
  * size, position, or number of chloroplasts
  * cell wall ornamentation (stains to use?)
  * branching patterns (number of cells before branching, shape of branching cell)
  * position, size, attachment or other features of gemmae
  * others?

Things to investigate:
  * Are there dichotomous keys to filamentous algae? What traits do they use?
  * What methods are used to highlight cell wall ornamentation or different internal structures?
  * Can I find a set of primers that consistently amplify either different lengths for the 3 species, or primer sets that are specific to species so I can quickly identify single gametophytes through PCR?

If I can identify fixed characters, test those characters by visually inspecting other samples (mine, Don Farrar's, or others) and then using DNA markers to confirm the species assignment from morphology. Also look further into the GBS samples with mixed/uncertain species to see if I see evidence of more than one species within the sample or evidence of individuals with intermediate morphology.
