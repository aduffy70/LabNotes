From discussion with Bryan Piatkowski while at the "Shaw lab bog" in Duke Forest...

# Problem
It appears that sometimes the Sphagnum bartlettianum patch at the bog has red in the leaves and sometimes not. It isn't clear whether that is being driven by light (as leaves fall increasing levels at the forest floor or as daylengths change) or by temperature.

Jon suggests that the same question could be asked of the Southeastern US S. magellanicum plants (which are probably a different species?).

We have clonal colonies of S. magellanicum and we can collect S. barlettianum from the bog to test this by growing replicates of each species under high and low light (or long and short days) and high and low temperatures.

This is a short-term, small-scale project that could be good for an undergraduate researcher.

For S. magellanicum, where we also have increasingly rich genomic information we could use the same plants to look at gene expression differences in genetically identical clones with and without red in the leaves from these different treatments. This would tie in neatly with Bryan's work on orthologs and homologs of anthocyanin pathway gene families in Sphagnum. Which of those genes are actually turning on and off to produce the color? It could be a full GWAS RNA sequencing project or something targeted to measure expression of specific genes with qPCR.  

# Questions

* Where would we grow them? We have the growth room for warm temps but is the cold-room too cold?

* How would we control light levels accurately (boxes with lights inside so all other light is blocked?)?

* Ideally we would use clones. We have them for S. magellanicum. How long would it take to grow them up for S. barlettianum?

* How can we quantify "redness" of plants? Image processing? Extract and quantify the chemicals that make the red color?
