I replaced my Ubuntu 16.04 Gnome edition install with Ubuntu 19.04 on my 2012 Macbook Pro:

  * Downloaded iso and created startup usb.
  * Installed a minimal install over the top of 16.04.
  * Followed [instructions here][1] to get wired and wireless connections working.
    - Need to check with IT to figure out why I can't join DukeBlue but I can access DukeOpen.
  * Installed Chrome with deb from Google.
  * Installed Dropbox from Dropbox.com, connected to my Duke Bio account, and set selective sync to not pull down everything from the shared lab files.
  * Made just minor appearance/settings tweaks
  * Installed Gnome Tweak from Ubuntu software and changed:
    - size of icons in side bar
    - removed home and trash icons from desktop
  * Installed synaptic manually with apt.
  * Installed from synaptic:
    * Libreoffice writer, calc, draw, and impress
    * gimp
  * Installed r-base with apt
  * Install RStudio from ???
  * Still to install: atom, aliview, skype, figtree
  * Still need to adjust bashrc settings
  * Still need to setup scripts for labnotes system
  * Others???
