# Problem

We have evidence for (Northern NJ/DE to Newfoundland) and Southern (DE/VA to FL/TX) groups of S. macrophyllum and want to see how they fit in with each other and related species.

# Analysis

Do a run with macrophyllum (North and South), cribrosum, cyclophyllum, and pylaesii, but not the outgroup cyclophyllum (P9_NCCarteret), or the microcarpum, guwanense outgroup. Also removed the samples with no vouchers or accession info.
  * 223 samples remain (5 removed)
  * 16 loci
