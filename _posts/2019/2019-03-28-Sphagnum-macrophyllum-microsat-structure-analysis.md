# Problem

We have evidence for (Northern NJ/DE to Newfoundland) and Southern (DE/VA to FL/TX) groups of S. macrophyllum and want to see how they fit in with each other and related species. Note- these do not appear to be the same samples used in the S. macrophyllum DNA sequence analysis.

# Data
  * Original "rawdata" spreadsheet with microsat data was in ShawLab/Aaron/Subsegunda_geography_diploids and Blanka added georeference data.
  * My files are in ShawLab/Aaron/Active/S_macrophyllum_biogeography/structureoutput_from_microsats. I removed samples from the dataset that have no vouchers available or no accession info.
    - 223 samples remain (5 removed)
    - 16 loci

# Analysis

  * Mapped the georeference lat/long on Google maps [(available here)][1] to get the state/province for each sample.
  * Ran structure on the Duke Computing Cluster with all 223 samples and 16 loci.
