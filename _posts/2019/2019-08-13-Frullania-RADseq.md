Two files of Frullania data from Blanka Aguero. There seems to be a problem with the barcodes (many reads without an exact barcode match) and she wants to know if these data can be salvaged.

The 2 files are just the results of a single Illumina run that has been split in half for easier transfer. Only one barcode file is needed. I am combining them into a single fastq.gz file before processing in ipyrad.
  * L001 = 137362236 reads
  * L002 = 139411418 reads
  * Combined = 276773654 reads
