S. denticulatum and S. auriculatum in Europe used to be conspecific with S. lescurii, so we should check that the Northern cluster of S. lescurii don't actually cluster with European samples. We have Mariana's European microsat data, which should have used the same loci and locus names as her North American lescurii data. Pull a range of European samples into the analysis and check.
