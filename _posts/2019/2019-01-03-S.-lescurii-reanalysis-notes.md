# Problem

We have microsat Structure evidence for a Northern S. lescurii group in Newfoundland, separate from samples in Nova Scotia and south. We need to look at Isolation By Distance (IBD) in the full dataset and within the groups. Also we need to verify that this is really a N-S split like the other diploid Subsecundas and not a case of a European+NA taxon and a NA taxon that just look similar.

Sphagnum auriculatum (aka Sphagnum denticulatum) in Europe used to be conspecific with S. lescurii, so we should check that the neither cluster of S. lescurii group with with European auriculatum samples. We have Mariana Ricca's European microsat data [from this paper][1], which included NFLD lescurii and European auriculatum, but not any lescurii from the southern cluster.  We need to pull those European auriculatum samples into this analysis.

# Data
Mariana's auriculatum data is on Dropbox at Shaw Lab/ArchivedSandy_July2010/DVD2-4/DVD4_Sphag_Msat_Misc/NFLD&Norway/NOR_NFLD_masats_Master_w_coll#s.xls
