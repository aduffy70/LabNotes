# Problem

We have microsat Structure evidence for a Northern S. lescurii group in Newfoundland, separate from samples in Nova Scotia and south. We need to look at IBD in the full dataset and within the groups. Also we need to verify that this is really a N-S split like the other diploid Subsecundas and not a case of a European taxon in the North looking similar to a North American taxon in the south:

S. denticulatum and S. auriculatum in Europe used to be conspecific with S. lescurii, so we should check that the Northern cluster of S. lescurii don't actually cluster with European denticulatum or auriculatum samples. We have Mariana's European microsat data, which should have used the same loci and locus names as her North American lescurii data. If she already did an analysis including NFLD lescurii samples and the European samples then we already have the answer. If not--or if we haven't published that result--we need to pull a range of European samples into this analysis and check.
