# Problem

We have microsat Structure evidence for a Northern S. lescurii group in Newfoundland, separate from samples in Nova Scotia and south. We need to look at Isolation By Distance (IBD) in the full dataset and within the groups. Also we need to verify that this is really a N-S split like the other diploid Subsecundas and not a case of a European+NA taxon and a NA taxon that just look similar.

Sphagnum auriculatum (aka Sphagnum denticulatum) in Europe used to be conspecific with S. lescurii, so we should check that the neither cluster of S. lescurii group with with European auriculatum samples. We have Mariana Ricca's European microsat data [from this paper][1], which included NFLD lescurii and European auriculatum, but not any lescurii from the southern cluster.  We need to pull those European auriculatum samples into this analysis.

# Data

  * Mariana's auriculatum data is on Dropbox at Shaw Lab/ArchivedSandy_July2010/DVD2-4/DVD4_Sphag_Msat_Misc/NFLD&Norway/NOR_NFLD_masats_Master_w_coll#s.xls
  * The North American lescurii microsat data, Matt Johnson's Genalex and Structure analysis results, and georeferencing info from Blanka Aguero are at Shaw Lab/Aaron/Subsecunda_geography_diploids/diploid_lescurii/

# Analysis

## Structure with just Northern and Southern lescurii

Already done by Matt Johnson. No need to rerun.

## Structure with European, Northern, and Southern lescurii

Just checking to be sure the Northern and Southern lescurii clusters are closer to each other than either is to European used-to-be-lescurii species.
  * Combined the North American lescurii microsat data (NoClonesByState) with 28 Norwegian auriculatum samples from Mariana's data (there were 38 but I dropped one with mostly missing data and 9 with duplicated multilocus genotypes).
  * Ran Structure on Duke Computing Cluster. Evaluated Kmeans and Evanno deltaK with StructureHarvester, combined replicates at each K with CLUMPP, and visualized in R.
    * 165 samples, 12 diploid loci
    * K1 through K10 with 10 reps each
    * 50000 burnin and 5 million cycles

## Isolation by distance

For all NA lescurii and separately for Northern and Southern clusters.
  * 137 samples after removing duplicate multilocus genotypes (same dataset Matt used for Structure analysis).
  * Fixed a couple samples with bad georeference data (flipped the sign of the longitude because they were appearing in Kyrgystan).
  * Replaced 0's for missing data with -9's because they cause problems when reading the dataset into R
    * If you don't specify that 0=missing, they get treated as another allele--inflating genetic distances. If you do specify 0=missing any allele with a 0 in it (90, 102, etc) is treated as missing data (a bug?)--increasing missing data and reducing genetic distances. __I rechecked the S. carolinianum and S. macrophyllum analyses. S. carolinianum was also affected by this bug, so I reran that analysis. S. macrophyllum was ok.__
  * Mapped samples [in Google Maps][2] and verified the mapped locations fit the state and site number info.
  * Classified samples by structure cluster: Northern, Southern, or admixed (>10%)
  * Generated a table of all pairwise combinations of sample coordinates with my coordinatepairs.py script
  * Got the distances with [online calculator][3].
  * Categorized pairwise comparisons based on whether the two samples are in the same Structure-identified cluster or in different clusters, using my classifycomparisons.py script.
  * Looked for evidence of IBD with Mantel tests in R for all samples together and within the groups identified by Structure (at K=2 and K=3).

# Results

## Structure with European, Northern, and Southern lescurii

Structure including European (Norway) auriculatum seems to rule out the possibility that one of the clusters (Northern or Southern) is just disjunct members of the European species:
  * At K=2 we have a European cluster, a Southern cluster, and Newfoundland samples all admixed 90Southern:10European. Definitely NOT what would be expected if either the Southern or Northern samples were really just the same as European.
  * At K=3 (the "best" K) We have separate European, Southern, and Northern clusters with few admixed individuals.
  * At K=4 we get essentially the same clusters as Matt's K=3 analysis (with, of course, an extra cluster for Europe).

## Isolation by distance

  * We have evidence of IBD for all samples combined (correlation 0.259, p<1e-04)  and for the separate clusters:
    * Northern (correlation 0.129, p<0.0028)
    * Southern (correlation 0.124, p<1e-04)
  * Using the K=3 clusters (from Matt's S. lescurii-only Structure analysis), there is evidence of IBD for Northern and the midatlantic Southern2, but not for the more widespread Southern1. Though in this analysis we have split into so many groups and removed so many admixed samples we may not really have enough pairwise comparisons in each group.
    - Northern (correlation 0.145, p<0.0017)
    - Southern1 (correlation 0.036, p<0.247)
    - Southern2 (correlation 0.317, p<0.0036)
  * The clusters differ in their geographic ranges but have similar ranges of pairwise genetic distances (as opposed to S. macrophyllum where the clusters have very different genetic distances).
