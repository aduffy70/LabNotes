# _Sphagnum lescurii_

Analyses:
  * Structure - DONE (previously)
  * Structure including Norwegian _S. auriculatum_ - DONE
  * PCA but it was done by state. Redo by cluster.
  * Isolation by distance (IBD) - DONE
    - All North American lescurii
    - K2 clusters (Northern and Southern) separately
    - K3 clusters (Northern, Southern, and Midatlantic) separately
  * Population diversity statistics - DONE (previously for K3 clusters)
    - Molecular variation within/among populations
    - Sample Size, Number of Alleles, Number of Effective Alleles, Information Index, Observed Heterozygosity, Expected and Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity, and Fixation Index

# _Sphagnum carolinianum_

Analyses:
  * Structure - DONE (previously)
  * PCA - DONE (previously)
  * IBD - DONE
  * Population diversity statistics
    - Molecular variation within/among populations - DONE (previously)
    - Sample Size, Number of Alleles, Number of Effective Alleles, Information Index, Observed Heterozygosity, Expected and Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity, and Fixation Index - SHEET MISSING FROM GENALEX OUTPUT?

# _Sphagnum macrophyllum_

Analyses:
  * Maximum likelihood phylogeny (macrophyllum, cribrosum, cyclophyllum, pylaesii, microcarpum, guwassenense) - DONE
  * Structure - DONE
  * PCA
  * IBD - DONE
  * Population diversity statistics
    - Molecular variation within/among populations - DONE (previously)
    - Sample Size, Number of Alleles, Number of Effective Alleles, Information Index, Observed Heterozygosity, Expected and Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity, and Fixation Index - SHEET MISSING FROM GENALEX OUTPUT?

# Figures and Tables for Manuscript

The text will address each species separately but we are combining figures and tables from all species:

## Figures

  * Figure 1 - Maps (3 acrossed?)
  * Figure 2 - Structure plots (3 down?)
    - K2 & K3 for _S. lescurii_
    - K2 for _S. carolinianum_
    - K2 for _S. macrophyllum_
  * Figure 3 - Isolation by distance (IBD) (3 down?)
    - K2 or K3 for _S. lescurii_???
  * Figure 4 - PCA plots (3 acrossed)
  * Figure 5 - Cartoon ML phylogeny for _S. macrophyllum_
  * Supplemental Figure 1 - Full ML phylogeny for _S. macrophyllum_

## Tables

  * Table 1 - Vouchers (Blanka is working on it)
  * Table 2 - Diversity stats
    - Alleles per locus
    - % Polymorphic loci
    - Expected Heterozygosity
    - Genetic differentiation of clusters (Fst, Gst, D?)
    - Distribution of variance between clusters (AMOVA)
    - Shannon's Index
