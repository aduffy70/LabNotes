# Sphagnum lescurii

Analyses:
  * Structure - DONE (previously)
  * Structure including Norwegian S. auriculatum - DONE
  * Isolation by distance (IBD) - DONE
    - All North American lescurii
    - K2 clusters (Northern and Southern) separately
    - K3 clusters (Northern, Southern, and Midatlantic) separately
  * Population diversity statistics - DONE (previously for K3 clusters)
    - Molecular variation within/among populations
    - Sample Size, Number of Alleles, Number of Effective Alleles, Information Index, Observed Heterozygosity, Expected and Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity, and Fixation Index

Figures:
  * Structure K2 & K3 for North American lescurii
  * IBD plot (Just K3? K2 & K3?)
  * Map?

Tables:
  * Voucher/locations table
  * Population diversity stats (using K3 clusters as populations?)

# Sphagnum carolinianum

Analyses:
  * Structure - DONE (previously)
  * IBD - DONE
  * Population diversity statistics
    - Molecular variation within/among populations - DONE (previously)
    - Sample Size, Number of Alleles, Number of Effective Alleles, Information Index, Observed Heterozygosity, Expected and Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity, and Fixation Index - SHEET MISSING FROM GENALEX OUTPUT?

Figures:
  * Structure K2
  * IBD plot
  * Map?

Tables:
  * Voucher/locations table
  * Population diversity stats (using K2 clusters as pops)

# Sphagnum macrophyllum

Analyses:
  * Maximum likelihood phylogeny (macrophyllum, cribrosum, cyclophyllum, pylaesii, microcarpum, guwassenense) - DONE
  * Structure - DONE
  * IBD - DONE
  *

Figures:
  * Full ML tree
  * Cartoon ML tree
  * Structure K2
  * IBD plot
  * Map?

Tables:
