  * Ran some test queries on the DRK12 Database with Paul Wolf
  * Tamra(?) returned all the reagents/supplies we lent to Dr. Mott (SYBRSafe, blue juice, ladder, the blue light for visualizing gels, the PCR kit I made for BIOL3065 Genetics Lab).  I put them all away in the lab.
  * DRK12 Database meeting.  {I need to really focus on not interrupting or trying to redirect other people's explanations of technical topics.  Just because it isn't the way I would explain it doesn't mean it isn't working for others.}
  * Read paper from Paul about using undergraduate courses to advance a research program <a href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001174">doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001174</a>
