  * At iSIT PD we discovered most Davis district teachers can't use Google Sites w/students so I created Google Docs versions of the Module 2 webpages they can use instead.  I set them up in the template gallery and Harrison Beckett shared them with the teachers at the 3rd day of PD.
  * Organized the mess in Google Docs.  Placed everything in categories so it will almost work like they are folders.
