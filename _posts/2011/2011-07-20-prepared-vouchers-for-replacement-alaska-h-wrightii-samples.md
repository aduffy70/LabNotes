  * Delivered the samples and collection info to Michael Piep at the herbarium and emailed a copy of the collection labels.
  * Collection numbers: 8319, 8329, 8334, 8335
  * 8338 and my collections were already deposited, so the only voucher missing is for 8320.  Neither of us have any surviving tissue for that collection so it won't be vouchered.  It is a second population from the same island as 8319 (Mitkof) so it is not critical.
  * The tissue that wasn't needed for vouchers is now in glass mini-terraria.
  * I need to add potting soil to maintain moisture but couldn't get into the greenhouse today.  I suspect the lack of potting soil to moderate moisture extremes is what caused the my original Alaskan H. wrightii samples to die.
