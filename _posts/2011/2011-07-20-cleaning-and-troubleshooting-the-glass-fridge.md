The large glass-doored fridge in the lab is not running and may have been dead for a month or more (based on the last time I remember opening it or hearing it run)

  * Verified that it is plugged in
  * Unplugged it and verified that the wall outlet works
  * Left it unplugged about 15 minutes and plugged it back in to see if it might 'reset'
  * Adjusted the temperature control up and down.  It clicks when it passes 8-9 on the scale but the there is no other sound or activity
  * I don't see any breakers or fuses on the outside of the fridge.  Need to remove the front access panel

Most of what is in the fridge are long forgotten samples and reagent solutions (many of which don't really need refrigeration).  I started sorting through what could be salvaged and what should be discarded.
