To save space on Catacombs drive, do not backup large files from crozier that are already backed up in other ways or are not needed:

  * Music library (backed up on laptop/time machine)
  * Photo library (backed up on laptop/time machine)
  * Public blast databases (we can download them again if needed)
  * Chrome cache files (not needed)
  * Imprudence cache file (not needed)
  * Any Opensim backups (base opensim can be downloaded again and my mods are backed up on Github)
  * Items in ~/Dev/Backups (these are opensim backups that need to be sorted/removed)
  * Items in ~/Backups (these are backups from other machines)
  * DO still backup thunderbird cache files (this is my email backup)
  * DO still backup Dropbox. Â (active files so the more copies the better)

Reduced backup from 80 to 30 Gb (but no difference in tar.gz file size).

Need to organize things so large 454 data sets and assemblies that will never change don't get backed up repetitively.

Updated the weeklybackups alias and the instructions for making a monthly tar.gz.
