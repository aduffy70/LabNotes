  * Checked VPGsim exercise regions.  Running fine at reasonable load levels.
  * Ken Karol has room on a sequencing run.  We need 5ug of DNA to include a sample.  Do we have a filmy, Lygodium, and Gleichenia?  Ideally the same taxa we used in the analysis where I mapped out partial genomes.  This may allow us to complete those genomes.
  * VPGsim exercise Day2 (Thursday)
