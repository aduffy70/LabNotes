She is trying to repot the greenhouse ferns but wants to avoid wasting time on plants that are not needed or are actually weeds that have taken over a pot.

I planned to go through and mark pots where the plant species and the label do not match (weeds) or identify which plant in pots of mixed species match the label, but I only have Paul Wolf's early collection notebook (up to #332 and I need the 700's-800's).

Marianne will hold off on the repotting until I can discuss with Paul - Added to list of things to discuss when he returns from the Arctic.
