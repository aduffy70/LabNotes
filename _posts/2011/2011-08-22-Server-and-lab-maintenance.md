  * Replaced case fan on cordate - the existing one was spinning at a very slow speed and making grinding noises. Â Used the expansion slot fan (that was originally in crozier but was too noisy for use in the office)
  * Worked with Callan on relabeling lab cabinets and cleaning the lab food fridge
