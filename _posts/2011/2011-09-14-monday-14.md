  * Watered gametophyte cultures and filled humidity tanks.  The newest Alaskan samples in large bottles are clearly starting to mold, so I applied a heavy dose (1 fungicide:3 water) of Dacronol directly to the plants.  The plants from those same collections that are growing in petri dishes look a bit faded but have no visible mold.
  * Discussed results of iSIT module 2 pilot, computer backup strategies, and python numpy module installation on OSX Lion with Paul Wolf
  * Sent invitations to other evolution-focused students for Robert Pennock lunch on Thursday.
  * Re-read Pennocks paper on Avida-Ed
