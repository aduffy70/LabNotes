  * Sciencesim Senate mtg - Mic Bowman recommended looking at the viewdistance setting on my vpgsim regions.  If I have it set higher than 512 then non-adjacent regions COULD effect each other like I am seeing.  I know I didn't intentionally change that but perhaps I was playing with that months ago and copied it forward into these regions?
