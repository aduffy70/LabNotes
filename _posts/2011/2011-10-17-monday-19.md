  * Debugging the VPGsim issues and thinking about how to narrow down the problem once the activity is over.
  * Kept a top shell running to monitor the simulations.  No issues while I was watching.
  * Advanced Programming for Biologists (Using a debugger) - too bad debugging falls apart with multi-threaded programs or programs that have time critical interactions with other programs (opensim)...
  * Max is making travel arrangements for the iSIT winter training next month.  I'll have the option of travelling each day or staying overnight.
