Attending: Paul Wolf, Michael Orr

  * Talked about plan for keeping names out of the research materials.  Michael will make a number to name cross-reference and students will only use the number on documentation.
  * Paul already has 3 of the DRK12 laptops.  Todd Campbell says we have two more but will be short a charger.  I'll charge everything tomorrow so it should not be an issue.  Several students in each class already have laptops as well.
  * I need to finish the assignment instructions before week 2.
