  * Create guidelines for students creating VPGsim exercise proposals and discussed with Paul
  * Posted a set of plots from the very first population to the course webpage.  I lost those plots in the process of recovering the plots from the student's experiments but some of them hadn't reset the logging system so I had the log data and used it to regenerate plots.  We need this so they have something to compare their experiment to.
  * VPGsim exercise Day2 (Wednesday)
  * Byron Love brought Joan (lastname?) down to the office to talk about R.  She is struggling with some basic data processing tasks and I agreed to try to assist.
