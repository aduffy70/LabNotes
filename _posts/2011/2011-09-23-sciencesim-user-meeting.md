Attending: Shenlei Winkler, Doug Osborn, Cheryl York, Stephen Gasior

  * I met Stephen previously in Second Life as something Xootfly.  He is the one with the molecule models.  He has not tried using them in ScienceSim yet.  He is also involved in Genome Island and Biome and will be trying to bring those activities to ScienceSim.
  * Cheryl is involved in one of the Space-related organizations (not NASA) on SciLands in Second Life.
  * Doug asked about code for cellular automata so I pointed him to my github page.
