  * Quantified Trichomanes intricatum extractions
      * The CIB now charges for using the nanodrop ($5/month + $0.35/sample) and have removed our lab account from the system.Â  No one was around to help create an account so Hardeep Rai showed me how to use the Qubit in the Mock lab.
      * I wrote a [Qubit protocol][1].
  * Started more F82-1-6-3 extractions
