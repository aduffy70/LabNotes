The second try is always better than the first... wish I had a third:

  1. Started with IRB permissions and pre-assessments (30 min)
  2. Brief (3-5 minute) intro to what the simulation and activity are about
  3. Setting up Imprudence Viewer and exploring the system (~30 min)
  4. Talking about fern lifecycle, Hardy-Weinberg, looking at data from our population, trying visualizations, and talking about how the simulation works (45 minutes)
  5. Playing with changing plant parameters and planting form (forgot to include playing with terrain settings) (15 minutes)
  6. Designing a class experiment and talking through what we might expect to see (30 minutes)
  7. Setting up class experiment (20 minutes)

  * The time spent playing with plant parameters instead of me talking about each of them seemed better.
  * This class was much more involved, vocal, and seemed to come into things with a better understanding of the biology (though I also did a better job of leading the discussion and asking questions).
  * We had more technical glitches with this group:
      * A viewer crash when they tried to take a photo
      * A HUD that disappeared from the screen and was even deleted from inventory?  When we got a new one from the HUD giver, it attached off the side of the screen where we couldn't see it.  Took a bit to figure out that it was there was just outside our view
      * The same group 'lost' their avatar.  We couldn't see it, even though we were clearly not in mouselook.  Re-logging fixed it.
      * When the groups started visiting each other's regions, one group forgot to go home so when we started testing the visualizations 2 groups were trying to run visualizations on the same region.
      * A couple random viewers or logouts but nothing that affected the regions or the simulations
  * This class also discovered the avatar appearance adjustments, the build tools, the tree planting tools, and the friending option.  A couple groups got into an avatar pushing match
