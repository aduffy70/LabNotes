This was a short day and could have been better utilized in other ways if I'd thought to structure the whole activity differently.

  1. Talked about tests they ran last week and took questions.
  2. Discussed the assignment description:
      1. Perform the experiment(s) that you proposed and write an individual (NOT group) report.
      2. Follow the course <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/usubiol3065/home/writing-guidelines" target="_blank">Writing Guidelines.</a>
      3. Include screenshots and/or plots where appropriate.
      4. If you have to deviate from your proposal (that isn't unheard of in science) be sure to explain how you deviated and why.
      5. The writing guidelines list 4 things that should be included in the discussion.  In addition to those 4 things, there is an **additional requirement** for this report: Explain how the parameters you used in the simulation affected individual plants and how how that affected the overall population. (5 points)
      6. When you have completed all of your experiments, please email Aaron (aaron.duffy@usu.edu) so he can shutdown your region and free up resources for other students.
  3. Talked about the problems with the technology and how to work around or within the limitations.
      1. Last week we had talked about having scheduled restarts every two days, but since the problem is not strictly time based and I can usually save most regions if I shut down problem regions quickly, that will not be necessary.
      2. If a group is repeatedly crashing before getting the data they need I told them to contact me so I can set them up on cordate.
  4. Talked to each group to be sure they had a good plan, knew how to implement it and didn't have any questions.

If I were doing this activity again, I think I would have them create their proposals in-class as a group on the second day and then start implementing them.  That way this 3rd day could be scheduled AFTER their experiments are done and could be used to share results with the class.  Each group has an interesting experiment that will hopefully help them explore some good content, but they will never see or hear about the content explored by other groups.  And the 3rd day as it stands now was very short and frankly not very useful for the students.
