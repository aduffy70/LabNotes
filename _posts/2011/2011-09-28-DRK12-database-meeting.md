  * Meeting with Paul Wolf to talk about his plans for the DRK12 database layout.  We simplified the table layout a bit and it is looking good.  He is recording the response to each instrument question as a separate row of a single table rather than a table for each instrument with a single row per teacher for all questions.  I had been envisioning it the other way, but the way he is going seems like it will make for a clearer, easier to maintain database.
