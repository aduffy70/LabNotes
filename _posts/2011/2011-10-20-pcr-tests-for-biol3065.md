  * Used water from the 'RNA only' stock
  * Primers are uncertain.  I have little left in my kit so I need to make new dilutions from stock but...
      * F1F and 1379R I have had problems with ALL stocks.  I did not use the newest ones I purchased since I've never had success with those.  i used the 'e' stocks.
      * The stock I've been using for atpB672F is empty so I used the only one left.  The concentration label is ambiguous.  One place says 41.8uM (which I can dilute) but the other says 41.8pM which seems impossibly small to be correct.  I am assuming the uM marking is correct.  For aptB 384R I a using the same stock I have been (418967 Sipes 09/18/98).
  * Using sTaq
  * Stored everything (reagents and the stocks I used to make them) in a box in the freezer labeled 'Duffy Genetics Lab PCR Tests'
  * Ran gel:
