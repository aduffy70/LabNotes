  * At Fort Herriman Middle School teaching iSIT module2 Pilot with Todd Campbell, Max Longhurst, Gayle Dowdle, and Harrison Beckett in Gayle's classroom.  I taught the last period of the day and worked with groups in other classes on their first round of inquiry.  The spring scales we had planned to use to measure force as we pulled objects up ramps were for too large a weight range and would not register accurate readings for light objects so we used PASCO force meters.  We had students us the Max reading which was problematic because it reads the spike at the start of the pull as you try to get the object moving and ignores the more important readings as the object is sliding up the ramp.
