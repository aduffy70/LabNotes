Discussing ideas for module 4 and deciding on a 3D platform for modules 3 & 4.

Benefits of Unity over Opensim:

  * Scales easily because it runs on their hardware, not ours
  * Not dependent on high bandwidth internet
  * More options for deploying (run from local file or on the web)
  * More likely to get past school firewalls and can run from local disk if needed
  * Better graphics
  * More stable
  * No ‘Second Life’ baggage
  * We control the complexity of the user interface
  * Faster – handles many more objects (40k plants vs 2.5k plants)
  * Size of region is more configurable
  * We control avatar appearance (no worries about lost clothing, inappropriate avatar modifications, breast physics, etc)
  * Can be embedded in a webpage along with webforms or data feedback pages

Drawbacks to Unity compared to Opensim:

  * Not a shared space (unless you use a backend server but that has same scaling problems as Opensim)
  * Not a persistent space (simulation only exists while you are running the program)
  * 3D object generation is more difficult – no prims, just mesh (libraries of objects are available, but custom objects may be expensive)
  * No avatar unless we create or purchase it
  * We don’t have the good contacts with the developer community that we do with Opensim

We agreed that we will develop modules 3 & 4 using Unity instead of Opensim.  Need to finish porting VPCsim to Unity.

Attendees: Todd Campbell, Max Longhurst, Atul Thapliyal, Brett Shelton, Paul Wolf
