  * Hardeep Rai is assembling another GBS run.  I can include a filmy.  I  need 150ng of DNA at 50ng/uL concentration.  This will be easiest to get from live tissue but I really want to know if GBS will work on preserved tissue so I will use one of Farrar's collections from the 1980's.
  * Experimented with how to clean tissue in preparation for DNA extraction.  I have a dime-sized chunk of tissue cleaned and ready.  This will likely not be enough to get the DNA I need but provides enough to test extraction and find out how much tissue I need to start with.
