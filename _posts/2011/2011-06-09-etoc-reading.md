  * [doi:10.1093/jxb/err029][1] A comparison of 454 data assembly software using a simulated transcriptome dataset.  It points to CLC workbench and TGICL as producing the most accurate assemblies. (Forwarded to Josh Der & Paul Wolf)
  * [doi:10.1186/1471-2164-12-293][2] Using simulations and replicated experiments on the same biological samples to see how much of the variability we see in RNA-Seq data is actual biological variability vs. technical variability (errors).  The errors are not negligible.
