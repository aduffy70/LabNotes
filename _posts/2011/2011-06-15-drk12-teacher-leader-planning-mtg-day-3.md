Tech notes:

  * Set up a google group for the PD week.  That way anyone who creates a doc during the week can easily share it with the group without everyone having to add everyone else to a group in their contacts list.

PD Planning:

  * Max needs a red card, yellow card, and green card to keep things moving along (perhaps a card with a turkey)

Module 2-4 planning:

  * Check out iMotionHD  ipod app for stop action photography and potentially calculating velocity/acceleration
  * For Module3 step through the trophic levels as the scaffolding iterations.  Start with just plants, then add herbivores, and finally carnivores.
  * SImulation model needs to change to include trophic interactions: 2-4 plants, 1-3 herbivores, 1-2 carnivores
  * Simplify!  Fewer choices for a simpler interface.
  * Be able to look at how changing the biotic or abiotic environment effects the organisms through their dependent relationships
  * To present data, use line graphs rather than bar graphs since that is what they focus on in 8th grade.
