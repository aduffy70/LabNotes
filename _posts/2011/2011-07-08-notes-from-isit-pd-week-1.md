Day 3 Recap
* Need to hit the technologies again. This time just give them a task and walk around providing support as they complete the task.

Notes for Day3 Sites, Picasa, and Google ID exploration
* This is all 'teacher hat' time.
* Goals:
    * Increase confidence in our ability to support students in using these tools
    * Set up the websites that each of us can use when we implement the module this fall
* Resources:
    * Google Sites Tutorial
    * Picasa Tutorial
    * Google ID Tutorial
    * Student Tutorials by role
    * Google's Tutorials
* Google Docs:
    * Fun with forms
* Picasa:
    * Creating new albums
        * 'problem' with default album names
        * What about creating an empty album?
    * Sharing settings
    * Changing album properties
    * Adding photos to an existing album
    * Rotating, cropping, and other edits
    * Deleting photos
* Google sites:
    * Creating a site
        * Using the iSIT template
        * Choosing a name
        * What is my site web address?
    * Sharing settings - owners vs. editors
    * Themes... or, why my site is prettier than yours
    * What comes with the basic iSIT template?
    * Different page types
    * Creating, moving, deleting pages
    * Go Go Google Gadgets!
    * Creating your own page templates
    * Site management
* Google IDs/Accounts:
    * Creating an account for your students
    * Ideas for managing access?

How should we provide tools to students?
* I see advantages and disadvantages to each of the 3 methods. If we put the tools out where we can see them it potentially limits student ideas. What happens when a student comes up with a great idea but needs something we didn't put out? Are we going to deny them some tool just because WE didn't think of it? If we make a list of tools it potentially forces students into thinking about tools in a particular way based on what we call it. A measuring wheel is only a tool for measuring distance when we see the name on the list, but a student seeing the tool on a table not knowing how it is 'supposed' to be used might imagine other things it could be used for like measuring angles, for example. If we don't give the students ANY guidance, we limit them to only tools they are aware of or can imagine. None of these 3 methods is ideal in every circumstance and all could be appropriate at times. The three methods could be used to scaffold students' ability to select appropriate tools by stepping through them in the order presented here.

Notes for Day 2 Google Docs discussion/exploration time
* We have 2 things we need to accomplish during this 45 minute session (8:45-9:30):
    * Wearing our 'learner hats' we need to create (or modify) the data collection forms we will need for inquiry round 2. Goal: Produce the data collection forms for your second experiment.
    * Wearing our 'teacher hats' we need to learn to use the tool well enough to set up for this module and also incorporate it into other classroom activities. Goal: Be confident that you can support your students in using this tool.
* Resources:
    * Google Docs tutorial (for teachers) on the Tutorials page
    * iSIT Module1 Student Tutorials by Role (for students) on the Resource Documents >> Instruction Modules page
    * PD participants with previous Google Docs experience
* Things to discuss before setting them loose to walk through the template and explore:
    * Organizing documents with Collections
    * Sharing settings
    * 'Global sharing' (private, anyone with link, public on web)
    * Sharing with specific individuals (view only, edit permissions)
    * Use example of experiment pages from yesterday
    * Collaborative editing - try sharing a document with a neighbor and see what happens if you both edit at the same time
    * Creating their own templates - for personal use or for the template gallery

Post-mortem notes:
* For some reason, when we tried to create a template, the choice to add a template to the gallery was not there the first 2 times we looked in the 'Actions' menu but it magically appeared the third time. Why? Is it perhaps a left-click vs right-click issue? Clicking the word 'Actions' vs clicking the down-arrow next to the word? Google wants to make sure we REALLY want to create a template so it makes us try, try, and try again?
* Collaborative editing of a single document by 15 people over the same network connection is not reliable.
* I need to clarify the Sharing settings, particularly the idea of visibility vs editability. If all we want to do is let others view a doc, we can set it 'public on web' or 'anyone with link' and we DON"T need to also share it with the isitpd group. Just link it to the isit site and everyone can see it there. The only time we need to share with the isitpd group is if we want others to be able to edit, or if we want them to see it and we won't be linking it to the isit site. The unnecessary sharing isn't really a serious problem, but it does create unnecessary emails and anytime we allow someone editing rights that they don't really need it creates an opportunity for things to get messed up.

PD Day 1 Notes
* Only 'owned' sites appear in the My Sites list on google sites. Sites that are shared with me won't appear here. So, in the instructions for students, rather than directing them to sign in to sites.google.com and having them pick a site from the list we should have them navigate to the site url and sign in to it using the link in the footer. That will work for sites they own and sites that are shared.
* The 'Web Page Group' in the student tutorials is the 'Questions Group' in the field activity. The student tutorials need to be clear about how the roles in the field correspond to the roles in the computer lab.
* A couple people had problems changing the name of their Google Docs. Rather than clicking on the file name, they were putting a name in cell A1. I don't think this can be clarified easily in the written instructions, but a labeled screen shot might help with this problem and could make other steps more clear as well.
* On the Picasaweb gadget, one group's photos wouldn't appear when they entered their email in the gadget preferences, but they did appear when they left off the '@gmail.com'??? The other group's photos show up fine when using the entire email address. Need to investigate...
* Student tutorial for Species Data group doesn't tell them to set the sharing options for the Docs they create. No one else can see the datasheets on the website if they aren't set to 'Anyone with the link' or 'Public on the web'.
