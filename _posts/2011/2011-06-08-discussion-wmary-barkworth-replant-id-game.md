Mary is interested in creating a game-like computerized plant identification tool that students can use to build their plant identification skills.  She says there are some basic tools already available but that students find them boring to use.

Ways to turn plant id into a game:

  * Provide students with images or information about only one plant character at a time and have students try to minimize the number of features it takes to get a correct id
  * Allow them to select the order that they view the characters so they have to think critically about what information would let them id the plant faster
  * Have a way to compare their results to their peers so it becomes competition against oneself and the group
  * Start with simpler identifications but unlock increasingly difficult levels based on their achievements
  * Penalize wrong answers to discourage guessing

To do this, you would need a good database of plant images and/or textual information about plants.

Would they be trying to do this from memory or using a key?

Are they trying to id to species? Genus?  Just to plant families? Maybe give points separately for all 3 (i.e., how many pieces of info did it take you to get family?  To get genus?  To get species?)
