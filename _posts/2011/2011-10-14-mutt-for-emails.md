  * Tested mutt as an email client.  Set it up on spore and got it working with gmail & biomail accounts.  The only thing I couldn't get working correctly is urlview because the main repository url is a dead link and I couldn't get homebrew to pull from the mirrors successfully.  Without urlview i can't view html mail messages easily - I see all the html tags.
