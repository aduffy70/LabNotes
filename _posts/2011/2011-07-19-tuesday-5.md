  * NUSTLI PD - Got participants set up to use their Google Site.  There are 2 ways to add users to a google group: sending an invitation email and adding them directly.  If you use the email method they MUST click the link in the email to be added to the group and gain access to group resources.  If you use the direct method they can immediately start accessing group shared resources without taking any other action first.
  * ScienceSim senate meeting.  Discussed need to discuss expectations with OMF.  I have concerns about whether we will be able to make this transition successfully, and doubts about whether we even should. Need to get these thoughts on paper and share with the senate group.
  * Noticed that the large glass fridge in the lab is not working.  It is warm and dry inside suggesting it failed a long time ago, so there is no need to scramble to save the contents.  I'll clean it out and troubleshoot later this week.
  * Received Hymenophyllum wrightii vouchers for Alaskan populations from Mary Stensvold.  These replace the clones I had that dried out or molded.  They are sealed in baggies so I placed them in the (working) refridgerator.
