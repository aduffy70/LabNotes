Planning session for the Fort Herriman pilot of iSIT module 2:

Attending: Todd Campbell, Max Longhurst

Need website template for the pilot (I need to create this):

  * One site per class
  * include calculator for ramp size
  * template for data entry with just blank rows and columns
  * template for data entry for inquiry round 1 with Jared's data and spaces for the students' results organized first by object measured with a measurement from each group within that.
  * include tutorials
  * template for the students experiment reports with research question, hypothesis, space to insert data from a google doc, space to include photos, conclusions, and additional questions

Tutorials (I need to create these):

  * Tutorial for getting a photo into a site through Picasa
  * Tutorial for finishing their experiment page

Role descriptions (Todd will create these)

We will be commuting back and forth rather than staying in a hotel

Background info (from Max's email):

> As we continue our final preparations for the pilot at Ft. Herriman on September 8,9,12, &13 I wanted to give some basic information and get us all thinking about what we will be sharing with Gayle's students. First, thanks Gayle for sharing your kids with us. Now for the details

> Gayle has 6 sections this is how we propose the instruction occur. Each member of the team will teach one class period followed by short fast debriefing that primes the next instructor for a new class.

> The following schedule is up for discussion if you see a need to switch things up let me know.

> 1st Period – Todd

> 2nd Period – Harrison

> 3rd Period – Max

> 4th Period – Todd

> 5th Period – Gayle

> 6th Period – Aaron
>
> Gayle will provide the scales and basic materials for building the ramps.

> USU will bring 6-8 boards for ramps and laptop computers for the student teams.

> Attached to this email is an example of the "Data" set Todd and I will use for the starter on Day 2. Please feel free to access and share a different data set that may target other student interests.

> Aaron, Todd, and I will be working on the website access and the tutorials that we will be using next week. If you have input let us know ASAP.
