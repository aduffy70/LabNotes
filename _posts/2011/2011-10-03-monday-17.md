  * System upgrades on gemmae, crozier, plastid, cordate, blastbox, and spore (did not update Drupal or WordPress).  All linux boxes required a dist-upgrade and restart.  Plastid did not respond after being restarted or after being physically shut down and started, but when I attached a monitor to see what was wrong it started and responded normally.  It did do a harddrive error check so perhaps it was doing that before when it was non-responsive (though I did wait 10+ minutes).
  * Watered gametophyte cultures and filled humidity tanks.  Treated all with fungicide (1 'squirt' dacronol to 200mL water).  Added full strength dacronol around the inside of the jar on the large Hymenophyllum wrightii samples.  There is no visible mold remaining on the plants but there was some around the edges.  Washed the fungicide down the glass with water so these probably will not need to be watered again for a couple weeks.
