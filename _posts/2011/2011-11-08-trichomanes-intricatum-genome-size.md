For GBS we need to know approximate genome sizes so samples from one taxon don't swamp out another.  The T. intricatum genome size and ploidy level are unknown, but we DO know these things...

  * In the Crepidomanes minutum complex genome sizes of sporophytes range from 40-200pg. [ doi:10.3732/ajb.1000484 ]( http://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1000484 )

  * T. intricatum has rbcL sequence identical to Crepidomanes schmidtianum, which has been reported as diploid and triploid [ doi:10.3732/ajb.0800122 ]( http://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.0800122 ) (and references within).

Paul recommends talking to Karen Mock or Chris Davies about using flow cytometry to find the genome size.  Talked to Hardeep about it and he says it won't happen in time for this GBS run but we can definitely do that.  Meantime, we will work with the current, broad size range from C. minutum (40-200pg - or likely 20-100 for gametophytes).
