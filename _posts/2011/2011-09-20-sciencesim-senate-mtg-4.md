Attending: Mic Bowman, Shenlei Winkler, Doug Osborn

  * Mic added new regions including nebadon's UCI campus and Linda Kellie's free content
  * I can move my region module demo region (currently called FernseedTemp) by mainland.  Mic will be taking down the old homestead regions and I can take one of those spots.  Doug will also be using a 2X2 section in that area.
  * Restarting weekly user meetings to try to strengthen community (stopped because it was just Mic, Doug and I attending, but we have many new users now).  Shenlei will suggest times and request feedback on the mailing list.
  * Need to finalize agreements with OMF for future of ScienceSim. Shenlei and Mic will both try to recontact John(?) at OMF to find out status.
