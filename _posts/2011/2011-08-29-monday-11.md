  * Genetic course VPGsim activity planning mtg.  I need to write a proposal for IRB and meet with Todd Campbell to get it through the approval process.  He provided reading material on possible assessment instruments.
  * Trying to figure out why Paul's laptop disk usage is so high.  Tried 'du' utility but it reports drastically different directory sizes than Finder.  Recommended Disk Inventory X, an OSX app that visualizes disk usage.  Grand Perspective is a similar app, but it doesn't let you drill down to different directory levels as easily.
  * First day of Ethan White's Advanced Programming and Databases for Biologists course.  I am not taking it for credit but will be sitting in and following along with the assignments.  It is based heavily on the Software Carpentry material <http://software-carpentry.org/>
