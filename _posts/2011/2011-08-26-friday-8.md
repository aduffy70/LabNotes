  * BGSA meeting
  * Hymenophyllum wrightii maps - showed them to Paul Wolf, and he suggests using the full west coast map with squares showing what is covered by the more detailed maps.  The more detailed maps were too tight to make it obvious where in the world they are, even with the cities added as reference.
  * Attended University Research Scholars Orientation for researchers working on NSF funded projects.  I think I took this my first year (I remember the case study examples on scientific misconduct) but they recommend retraining every 4 years so I am due again anyway.
  * After reading about Bot attacks on public opensim grids (rezzing objects to crash the region) I set all of my regions on ScienceSim to disable building by visitors.  The modules should still be able to add objects and users can still wear the HUDs needed to use VPGsim and VPCsim.
