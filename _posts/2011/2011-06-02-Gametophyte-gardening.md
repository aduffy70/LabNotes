**Gametophyte gardening:** Watered plants and refilled evaporation tank (completely dry).  1 dish had 10% completely dry substrate.  Dishes at the sides seemed dryer so I added a small tupperware as a second tank so the water surface extends almost all the way across the front of the chamber.   Still need to transfer some of the H. wrightii to new substrate and finish weeding the T. intricatum.

Cleaned and weeded Hawaiian filmy fern terrarium.  There are what look like filmy fern sporophytes starting to develop in 4 or 5 areas.  Photo:
