Re-extracting F82-1-6-3 to get more DNA.  Yield is low so it will take more parallel extractions to get the 150ng @ 50ng/uL that I need...

Soltis lab protocol.  Exceptions/notes:

  * 4 replicates (A-D) of F82-1-6-3
  * Appx nickel-sized section of tissue in each replicate
  * Cleaned of sand and organic contaminates
  * Same reagents (except 5mL of fresh CTAB+PVP+Bmerc solution) and grinding techniques as 10/19/11 extractions.
  * Incubated @55C overnight (started 1:30pm)

Continuing on 10/25/11

  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. + isoproponol:
      * A: 550 + 44 + 320.7
      * B: 600+ 48 + 349.9
      * C: 600+ 48 + 349.9
      * D: 550 + 44 + 320.7
  * Placed in -20 freezer @11am
  * Removed from freezer @ 4pm (5hrs)
  * Re-suspended pellets in 50uL TE buffer each
  * Stored in refrigerator overnight (5pm - 9am)

Continuing on 10/26/11

  * Ran gel 20 minutes @ 115V
  * Lanes:
      * 1: ladder
      * 2: F82-1-6-3 (A)
      * 3: F82-1-6-3 (B)
      * 4: F82-1-6-3 (C)
      * 5: F82-1-6-3 (D)
      * 6: ladder

      * Quantified with Qubit:
          * F82-1-6-3 (A) 38.5 ng/uL
          * F82-1-6-3 (B) 52.3 ng/uL *
          * F82-1-6-3 (C) 18.0 ng/uL
          * F82-1-6-3 (D) 24.3 ng/uL

        * This one alone provides everything I need for GBS: at least 50 ng/uL and 150ng DNA total.
