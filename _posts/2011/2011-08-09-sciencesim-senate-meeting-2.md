Attending: Doug Osborn, Robert Adams, Shenlei Winkler

Talked about community building and how we can attract new visitors, engage the visitors we get, attract new projects, keep the groups that come through the homestead program in the community. Â Possible ideas:

  * Inworld seminars and events
      * Science or tech talks
      * Building or scripting classes
      * project show-and-tell
  * More open hypergridding (we won't allow assets out, but can we have attachments work and allow outbound hypergrid?)
  * Bring back the 'ScienceSim distribution'
  * Consolidate regions so map gives a better picture of grid activity
  * Some method of telling visitors what is available on the grid:
      * Map on Newton?
      * Automatic link giver for the Places to Visit page on the wiki
      * Better guides on Newton (the easels in the observatory are not intuitive to find
      * 'Pixel' avatar greeter on Newton to click to get an info menu:
          * Places to visit/things to do/available resources
          * About ScienceSim
          * Attaching your project to our community
  * Revive user meeting
  * A working solution for voice on the grid
