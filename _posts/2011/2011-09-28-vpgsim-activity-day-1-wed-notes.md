  * The 'game' aspect of it was a big hit when they first logged in.  'I can fly!'
  * During the initial exploration time, people figured out how to do things I'd not included in the instructions.  Several groups were customizing avatars, one group started building and rezzing Linden plants, and one group found the VPGsim Controller (need to make this invisible and phantom) and sat on it.
  * Getting Imprudence installed and setup went smoothly for most.  One group was trying to log into the wrong grid, and one ended up on the Newton region.
  * The planting form was confusing.  People didn't immediately get that they would be using it multiple times in order to plant everything they needed.  The way the ploidy level you enter decides whether you are planting spores or sporophytes was not obvious.
  * I talked too much during the time that I was explaining how the simulation works and what features of the environment and plants can be controlled.  How do I make this explanation interactive?  Do I give them the 'about' sheet and set them loose with the forms???
  * I didn't tie back well to the content.  I tried to push connections between things happening to individuals and larger scale patterns but it was just too much talking.
  * Region #3 had an issue when they tried to plant their population.  It acted like there was still land where there was not and when we tried to clear the plants they never cleared.  We couldn't teleport out and I couldn't log or teleport in.  The region looked ok on console (dilation etc) but it showed 2 root agents when there were none and attempts to log in showed the error about not authenticating by IP.  I switched them over to region 9 to keep them moving and restarted region 3 (and set up a new population so group 9 can use region 3 Thursday).
  * I don't feel like they have any real feel for the things they could change in the population.  I talked about it forever but I was getting blank stares.  I need to give them time to play with setting up populations with different parameters and different starting pops.  I didn't give them any 'mucking around time' for this - they only set up one population and that was the one I told them to do.
  * I gave them the cheat sheet to play with visualizations and one group left the visualization section and ended up killing their population prematurely.
  * One group with an older white macbook had errors on the first imprudence startup about missing day setting 9pm,6pm, 3pm, etc. I think they downloaded it directly from Imprudence (not from my thumbdrive).  We said 'ok' to each error and it started and seemed to run correctly.
