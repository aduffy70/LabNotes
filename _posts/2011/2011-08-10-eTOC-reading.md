eTOC reading:

  * [doi:10.3732/ajb.1100010][1] Norm Wickett, Jessica Budke and others looking at rates of pseudogenation of a chloroplast gene acrossed the liverworts
  * [doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001096][2] Darwin's usage of the term'Tree of Life' should not imply that a paradigm shift is necessary to include things like horizontal transfer in an understanding of Darwinian evolution.
  * [doi:10.1525/abt.2011.73.6.8][3] An interesting way to engage students in inquiry... though I'm not sure how well this would be received at Utah State...
  * [doi:10.1525/abt.2011.73.6.10][4] This could work as an 'invitation' to learn activity for a biology course covering biological diversity (like the Biol 1020 labs at Utah State).
  * [doi:10.1073/pnas.1105467108][5] These 'asexual' ants turned out to be cryptically sexual with some sexual populations generating the diversity and repeatedly spinning off asexual clonal lineages.
  * [doi:10.1186/1471-2164-12-347][6] Using exon sequences from one species to target exon sequences from related species (in the same genus here) so you can economically get comparable sequences from throughout the genome from many individuals. Â Similar idea to RAD or GBS... restrict which parts of the genome get sequenced so you can get the same parts from multiple individuals.
