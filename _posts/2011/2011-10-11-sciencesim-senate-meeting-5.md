Attending: Robert Adams, Shenlei Winkler, Mic Bowman

  * Need to engage more than just Jonathon at OMF.  Shen will invite the rest of the board to participate.
  * Other options if OMF falls through: Overte? ACM/IEEE?
  * I moved my FernSeed Region Module region into one of the spaces that used to be part of the Fern SC09 demo.  Should be ok.
