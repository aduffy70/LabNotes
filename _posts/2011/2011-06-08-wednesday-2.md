  * Read about html5 canvas elements at http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html - this is what I need for the form to control VPCsim.  Note- it will require a modern browser (i.e. no support for IE6)
  * Discussion with Paul Wolf re: NOT contacting Olympic National Forest about H. wrightii yet.
  * Is YL Qiu's rtl gene that is found within a group II intron in algae and some bryophyte chondriomes but as a standalone gene in other bryophytes the same thing as matR?  I thought matR was the only group II intron-encoded orf in plant chondriomes.
