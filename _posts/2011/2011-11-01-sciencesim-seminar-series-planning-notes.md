<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This was a nice thought, but I just can't commit the time to it...</strong></span>

  * Day and time? Monthly or every two weeks?
      * Monthly will require less of my time and give more time to find meaningful presentations.
      * Bi-weekly could be easier to get momentum going.
  * Location?
      * A fixed location (public space on ScienceSim) makes it easier for people to find, even if we end up immediately teleporting to another region
  * Voice options?
      * Skype buttons - can we do this without it becoming a time consuming hassle each meeting?
      * Calliflower - do I still have an account?
      * Intel bridge - could we schedule one for this?
      * text chat only?
  * Who to have present?
      * Mic Bowman has offered - infrastructure, region modules, DSG (or probably any of a dozen other topics
      * Homestead region recipients
      * Justin Clark-Casey on NPC's, Diva on hypergrid, or other core devs (or other topics)
      * Robert Adams, Dan Lake, or others working in Opensim @ Intel
      * Nebadon or other OSGrid admins on managing a grid
      * Fleep on building and managing a community
      * Chris, Robin, Pathfinder, or Kyle from ReactionGrid on ??
      * Brett Shelton on games in education
      * Shenlei Winkler on orienting new users
  * What are the goals?Â  Who is the target audience?
      * Give people a showcase for their work on ScienceSim (or other grids?)
      * Are we targeting a science audience, a developer audience, an opensim audience, a virtual worlds audience, an edtech audience?
      *
