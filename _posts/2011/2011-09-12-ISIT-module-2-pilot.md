  * At Fort Herriman Middle School teaching the iSIT module 2 pilot: On the second round of inquiry we backed off the scaffolding too quickly and expected the students to create researchable questions, hypotheses, and procedures with peer support. Â We had not modeled this process for them before and it failed horribly.
