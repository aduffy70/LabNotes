  * I currently have 91 credits so I am eligible for Continuing Graduate Advisement (CGA) credits.
  * Prior to defense I need to make my program of study reflect what I really did.  Only the advisor's permission is needed to make these changes.
  * Need to submit Proposal Cover Sheet and Application for Candidacy 3 months prior to defense.
  * The commitee members who signed my comps form need to be the one to sign the Candidacy form (or authorize the dept head to sign for them).
  * The University and Grad school only require 3 CGA credits to count as a full time student, but the student loan system may require 6.  I need to check with them.  If they do require 6, I either have to pay for 3 additional CGA credits each semester or start paying back loans, whichever I prefer.
  * CGA credits do not need to be on my program of study.
  * The TA workshop does not need to be on my program of study.
