Attending: Angela, Gayle, Todd, Jared, Max, Jana, Harrison

The PD Model:

  * Discuss previous module experiences
  * Talk about when we will do module 2 - make expectations clear
  * Do the module
  * Find datasets for the 'invitation to learn' activity (Gayle's RPG armor, etc)
  * Learning the new tech (presentation software, iMotion, Splice, ???)
  * Develop ramp in-ramp out lesson plans
  * Present lesson plan

Technology:

  * Creating a form to do calculations - to convert angle to height
  * Velocity calculations (don't create these, show them how to make their own)
  * Splice (free app) tutorial (look for a second option)
  * App for rotating photos on the ipod (maybe necessary for using photos with Splice): Rotate & Crop (free)
  * We need a backup method for teachers without enough iPods... we can use Picasa.  A web album can hold both photos and videos and when embedded or displayed as a slideshow it will show the pictures and play the videos in order.  If you want a photo to display longer just put more than one copy of the photo in the webalbum.
  * I need to create an example presentation we can use in the classes at Herriman!
