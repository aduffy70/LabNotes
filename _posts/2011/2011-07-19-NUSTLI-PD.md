  * NUSTLI PD - Got participants set up to use their Google Site.  There are 2 ways to add users to a google group: sending an invitation email and adding them directly.  If you use the email method they MUST click the link in the email to be added to the group and gain access to group resources.  If you use the direct method they can immediately start accessing group shared resources without taking any other action first.
