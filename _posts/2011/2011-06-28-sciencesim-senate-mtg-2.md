Shenlei Winkler, Wilf Pinfold

  * Next homestead program will provide 4-region estates for a full year
  * Waiting on Robert Adams' part of the legal agreements? The user and region owner agreements are ready for lawyer review/feedback
  * National Park Service has provided the Gettysburg curriculum Shen needs to start developing the simulation content
  * I brought up the idea of creating a pre-configured ScienceSim distribution of OpenSim to make it as simple as possible to attach regions to the grid. Â This could include modules that might be useful for educators/researchers (visit tracking, chat logging, others?)
