  * Evolution of sex reading (from the Journal of Heredity ‘Evolution of Sex’ edition):

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esq009">doi:10.1093/jhered/esq009</a>The complementation hypothesis

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esq005">doi:10.1093/jhered/esq005</a>Looking at organisms with life cycle patterns that benefit from the advantages of both sexual and asexual reproduction and asking why all organisms don't follow this route

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esq014">doi:10.1093/jhered/esq014</a>Not finding any males or sexuals in thousands upon thousands of samples may not 'prove' there are none, but it does make it pretty darned likely - and you can use statistics to predict how low the number of makes or sexuals would likely be to not find any in that large of a sample.

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esq017">doi:10.1093/jhered/esq017</a>Using Avida to simulate sexual and asexual reproductive systems in a changing environment. The changing environment favors maintenance of sex, but it is still very difficult for sexual lineages to arise from an asexual lineage. I really need to play with Avida.
