  * The ramp height calculator would lend itself to being set up as a webapp rather than a google doc.  As a google doc, they either need to create their own copy or we will have to share the original with the world and make sure we've locked cells so no one can mess it up.  Also, you can't lock cells in Google Docs so students will likely break the formulas.
  * Need a google docs tutorial and a link to it
  * Need the first datasheet linked to the class page and the link to it needs to be in the data entry team's tutorial.
  * Add NCAA stats to the website template
  * Template for the report (web page) Reseearch question at top, then two columns: Things we know... questions you still have
