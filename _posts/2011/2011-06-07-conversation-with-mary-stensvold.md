She called when she received my email about voucher tissue.

  * She does not have tissue for 8320 - Mitkof Island (N).
  * She will mail tissue for the others (in baggies) so I can voucher them here.
  * She agrees that the Washington state plants likely represent the furthest south end of the range.  Scattered populations may exist further south but the are likely very few and isolated.
  * She thinks there very likely were plants extending west around the pacific rim during Beringia but the Aleutians don't have the habitat types where we find H. wrightii today.  But no one has looked.
  * She recommended that I contact Mark Skinner at the Olympic National Forest to let him know we found H. wrightii in his area.  I'll send him the manuscript draft.  She will email his contact info.

I shared the current plan for the manuscript and also what I would like to do next (compare Queen Charlotte sporophyte tissue and use GBS or other variable markers to look at population genetics acrossed the range).
