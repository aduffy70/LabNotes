  * Trying to figure out why Paul's laptop disk usage is so high.  Tried 'du' utility but it reports drastically different directory sizes than Finder.  Recommended Disk Inventory X, an OSX app that visualizes disk usage.  Grand Perspective is a similar app, but it doesn't let you drill down to different directory levels as easily.
