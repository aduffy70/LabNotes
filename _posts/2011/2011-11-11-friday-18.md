  * Cleaned and weeded the Hawaiian Vandenboschia tank.  I thoroughly cleaned moss and other contaminants from the end of the tank by the wall.  It needs more cleaning but I think with the sheer volume of contaminant tissue and the apparently unending spore bank it will be easier to start a new tank with fresh autoclaved potting soil and transfer the cleanest Vandenboschia tissue to that tank.  All that time that we were growing Pteridium and Phlebodium sporophytes in that tank has left way too many spores to deal with.
  * Transferred brown fridge contents back into the fridge now that it is defrosted.
  * Talked to Paul Wolf about flow cytometry to estimate genome sizes/ploidy levels in T.intricatum.  Karen Mock will be running flow cytometry soon and is willing to include a few samples, but I will need to find my own calibration samples (since her Aspen are too far diverged).  Paul recommends finding 3 ferns that have known chromosome counts/genome sizes on the Kew Gardens site that we also have tissue for in the greenhouse.  As an alternative, Ebihara & Nitta have known sizes and counts for some of their Trichomanes minutum samples and I could ask for tissue samples - perhaps in exchange for running some other samples for them.
  * Talked to Carol Rowe about her plans to set up a database for her microsatellite data.
