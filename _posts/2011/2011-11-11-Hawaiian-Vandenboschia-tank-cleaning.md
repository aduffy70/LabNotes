  * Cleaned and weeded the Hawaiian Vandenboschia tank.  I thoroughly cleaned moss and other contaminants from the end of the tank by the wall.  It needs more cleaning but I think with the sheer volume of contaminant tissue and the apparently unending spore bank it will be easier to start a new tank with fresh autoclaved potting soil and transfer the cleanest Vandenboschia tissue to that tank.  All that time that we were growing Pteridium and Phlebodium sporophytes in that tank has left way too many spores to deal with.
