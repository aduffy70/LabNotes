  * Watered cultures and refilled humidity tanks.  Less visible mold on Alaskan Hymenophyllum wrightii samples in large containers.  Treated again with Dacronol (sprayed full strength - 2 'squirts' per jar- directly on parts of the colonies with visible mold and then watered to distribute more evenly).
