  * At Fort Herriman Middle School teaching the iSIT module 2 pilot.  Instructions for google sites were a point of confusion.  The new look Google is applying to their apps changed the name of the Create Page button to New Page (though they kept the same shortcut key 'c' ?!) and the first three steps were to get them logged in and onto the class site, but we'd already logged them in and had the site loaded.
