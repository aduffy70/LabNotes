Created a website for this meeting (we will walk the walk): <https://sites.google.com/site/isitplanning>

These notes are also on that site for the rest of the group to access.

PD plan discussion:

  * Need to schedule time for the teachers to talk in small groups about where else in their classrooms they could use the tools and concepts they are learning in the PD. (Building their own literacies with the ICT's)  How can you use these tools for other topics?
  * Ask them:  What are the traditional methods we use for students to demonstrate learning (dioramas, written papers, oral reports) and how can we use ICTs in place of those (webpages, prezi's, wikis, blogs).  We need to create a bridge showing how the old tools can be enhanced by the new technologies.  How does this make it better?  What does it do besides replace the old tool? (Collaborate, communicate, & create). Get them to think and mentally flag in THEIR curriculum places where they could apply these tools.
      * Authentic audience
      * Go beyond the classroom
      * Persistent artifacts
  * Use google docs to collaboratively create a document recording the ways to use the tech.  (Use the tech as we are thinking about how to use the tech)
  * Keep these conversations tied to the idea of using inquiry in the classroom.
  * When we are doing this and are in 'learner' mode, don't pretend to be a student asking questions you think students might ask.  Be a learner and ask the questions you want to know.
  * Iteration vs. round - 'iteration' has meaning that is important to the way we use this word.  Use the word, but define it.
  * WE HAVE to have discussion at some point through the PD about how to incorporate discussions that will tie the questions that come up during the activity to the content that has to be covered.  It is possible to go through the inquiry without hitting any content and we have to ensure that the teachers know not to let that happen.
  * Can we utilize the Davis District standard lab exercise form in our Experiment page template.  It has most of what we have in our webpage template but with different wording.
  * Have them create a google doc with references to some tools that might be useful for support iteration 2 & 3. Link, description of link, and how student could use it.
  * Tell them to bring a laptop if they have one.

Literacies vs ICTs:

  * ICT's are the ability to use a tool.  Literacy is the ability to incorporate it into learning. Example - I can use a saw, hammer, and sandpaper, but I can't make fine furniture.  I have the ablity to use the tools, but I am not literate.

Tech notes:

  * For the PD, I need a list of all the google accounts and ideally set them up in a group so I can quickly give an entire  everyone access to the website and any google docs
  * If we don't explicitly give access to google docs they will show up as 'Anonymous' which hinders communication.
  * Put an editable glossary page on the PD website.
  * We need wireless access at Davis High.  Can we set up a wireless router?  We MUST test this before hand.
  * Instructions needed:
      * Creating google doc
          * Using templates
          * Sharing/permissions settings
      * Creating google site
          * Using templates
          * Setting up blog pages
          * Setting up Experiment pages
          * Adding/removing/editing pages
          * Using the different page types
  * Revise templates to align with Davis District Lab Record
  * Can we get isit.usu.edu and point it?
  * Have them use a personal google doc for their notes.
