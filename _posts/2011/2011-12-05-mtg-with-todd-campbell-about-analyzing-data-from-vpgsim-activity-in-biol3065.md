  * Use the IRB proposal as a starting point for the dissertation chapter/publication.
  * Todd will review it over the holidays and make notes of where it could be expanded.
  * Need to meet with Dan Coster or the stats group in the College of Education about what statistical tests to use.
  * Need to try analyzing a few of the reports using the rubric to see what issues may arise.
  * We haven't done effectiveness testing on the rubric so we will need to talk further about how to handle that.
  * Randomly select ~25% of the reports to get a second review by Todd to look at rating consistency.
