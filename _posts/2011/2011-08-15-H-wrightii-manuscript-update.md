  * Contacted Michael Piep  and got voucher numbers for the last batch of Alaskan Hymenophyllum wrightii samples.
  * Pinged Mary Stensvold about South East Alaskan Hymenophyllum wrightii locations.  Let her know I'm hoping to submit the manuscript very soon.
  * Submitted 6 Hymenophyllum wrightii sequences to genbank (rbcL and trnS-rps4 for a SE Alaskan, Vancouver Island, and Olympic Peninsula sample).
