Spoke with Mary Barkworth and Michael Piep about how best to preserve Hymenophyllum wrightii vouchers:

  * Separated from 5 to dozens of individual gametophytes from the live cultures
  * Used a microscope and tweezers to avoid moss, fungi and substrate
  * Selected individuals from throughout the plate including examples with gemmae
  * Placed gametophytes in labeled glassine envelopes
  * Michael placed the envelopes in the dryer at the herbarium.  When dry, he will place them (envelopes and all) in bryophyte packets.  Mary says they may store them with the bryophytes but place a sheet in the fern cabinets directing future users to their actual location.
  * I provided a printout of my collection information to Michael and emailed an electronic copy.
