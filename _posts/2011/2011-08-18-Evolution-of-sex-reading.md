  * Evolution of sex reading (from the Journal of Heredity ‘Evolution of Sex’ edition):

[doi:10.1093/jhered/esq009][1] The complementation hypothesis

[doi:10.1093/jhered/esq005][2] Looking at organisms with life cycle patterns that benefit from the advantages of both sexual and asexual reproduction and asking why all organisms don't follow this route

[doi:10.1093/jhered/esq014][3] Not finding any males or sexuals in thousands upon thousands of samples may not 'prove' there are none, but it does make it pretty darned likely - and you can use statistics to predict how low the number of makes or sexuals would likely be to not find any in that large of a sample.

[doi:10.1093/jhered/esq017][4] Using Avida to simulate sexual and asexual reproductive systems in a changing environment. The changing environment favors maintenance of sex, but it is still very difficult for sexual lineages to arise from an asexual lineage. I really need to play with Avida.
