Attending: Robert Adams, Doug Osborn

  * Experimenting with Bullet Physics on Scratch 01.  Interestingly, you can fly off the edge of the region in any direction and fly back.  You can go off the region, drop below ground level and then back into the region to get underground.
  * Doug is running into a 'Friends Connector' problem when trying to set up a new standalone region.  I set up brand new test regions a couple weeks ago and had no issues.
  * Robert will ping Mic/Shenlei about a meeting with OMF.  We need input to proceed with the various legal agreements.
