  * Revise the flow of the activity so the third day doesn't feel wasted.  Could we get them oriented and design their experiment in 2 days so they could run it and then share results the third day?
  * The Concord Consortium smart graphing page has some useful ideas for helping students understand the 4 ways of thinking about or interpreting experiments that provide plotted data:
      * The story of what was done (the experimental procedure)
      * The shape of the curve (the appearance)
      * The numerical values (x & y at each point)
      * The equations the data represents (the mathematical description)
  * By explicitly walking through an experiment talking about all 4 of these we could help students better interpret the data provided by VPGsim and connect that data back to what is actually happening in the simulation.  This would have been a valuable step that would have neatly supported the goals of my study.  Too late! Arghh.

  * Make sure you have a way to contact each group - I had groups that were continually crashing but until they got frustrated enough to contact me I couldn't help.
