  * Looked at Django as a local replacement for Google AppEngine.  It is already installed and configured on Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 so nothing was required to set up a basic development environment.
  * eTOC reading:

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001096">doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001096</a>Darwin's usage of the term'Tree of Life' should not imply that a paradigm shift is necessary to include things like horizontal transfer in an understanding of Darwinian evolution.

<a href="http://doi.org/10.1525/abt.2011.73.6.10">doi:10.1525/abt.2011.73.6.10</a>This could work as an 'invitation' to learn activity for a biology course covering biological diversity (like the Biol 1020 labs at Utah State).
