As an experiment I am going to try keeping my lab notebook in this electronic format. It could easily be an 'open' lab notebook, but for now it will be set to private.  I'll worry about how to share access with collaborators when the need arises. I will not transfer my old paper notebooks to this system - I'll just start from today - though I may pull in some selected data/media to test how best to organize things.

I am using a basic WordPress 3.1.3 installation on a private server (gemmae).

  * Plugins: Registered Users Only 1.0.3 (to restrict access to logged in users)
  * Theme: Suffusion 3.7.8
