Attending: Robert Adams, Doug Osborn, Shenlei Winkler, John ? Â (OMF)

  * Shenlei has possible timeslots for User meeting and will send it around for input (she wants to be sure an Intel rep can attend)
  * OMF is reviewing the legal docs
  * I will work on the ScienceSim distribution
  * L5's problems with textures may be related to trying to use .tiff files. The preferred format for alpha textures in .tga and no one on the call had even tried a .tiff.
