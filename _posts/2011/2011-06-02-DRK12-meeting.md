**DRK12 Meeting:** Trying to bring our module 1 and first year professional development (PD) into alignment with NYIT.  Getting the PD aligned is more critical than the module.  We have some serious differences in the direction we are going with modules and PD.  It looks like modules 1 & 2 will be fairly misaligned, with USU taking a (probably too) open-ended approach to the inquiry activities and NYIT taking a (probably too) proscriptive approach.  After this first PD we need to review, discuss and try to find middle ground - hopefully for the second PD but certainly for the third.  The software development Atul and I are doing for the third module will be very challenging if we are trying to cater to two different clients.

USU: Paul Wolf, Max Longhurst, Todd Campbell

NYIT: Lisa Coleman, Shiangkwei Wang, Hui-Yin Hsu
