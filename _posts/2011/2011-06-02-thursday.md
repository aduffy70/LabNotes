**Gametophyte gardening:** Watered plants and refilled evaporation tank (completely dry).  1 dish had 10% completely dry substrate.  Dishes at the sides seemed dryer so I added a small tupperware as a second tank so the water surface extends almost all the way across the front of the chamber.   Still need to transfer some of the H. wrightii to new substrate and finish weeding the T. intricatum.

Cleaned and weeded Hawaiian filmy fern terrarium.  There are what look like filmy fern sporophytes starting to develop in 4 or 5 areas.  Photo:

**DRK12 Meeting:** Trying to bring our module 1 and first year professional development (PD) into alignment with NYIT.  Getting the PD aligned is more critical than the module.  We have some serious differences in the direction we are going with modules and PD.  It looks like modules 1 & 2 will be fairly misaligned, with USU taking a (probably too) open-ended approach to the inquiry activities and NYIT taking a (probably too) proscriptive approach.  After this first PD we need to review, discuss and try to find middle ground - hopefully for the second PD but certainly for the third.  The software development Atul and I are doing for the third module will be very challenging if we are trying to cater to two different clients.

**Reading:**

  * <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02188.x">doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02188.x</a> Empirical evidence that haploids adapt faster than diploids. Theoretically, this is the expected result because the effect of a beneficial positive mutation in a diploid is reduced based on its level of dominance.  They used asexually reproducing isogenetic haploid and diploid yeast.
  * <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2010.12.009">doi:10.1016/j.gene.2010.12.009</a> Existing tRNAs in a genome sometimes get converted into another tRNA.  At first this seemed simple - just change a nucleotide in the anticodon - but they are talking about changes to a completely different tRNA so both the anticodon and the part that interacts with the amino acid would have to be changed.
  * <a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq385">doi:10.1093/jxb/erq385</a> Would be interesting to see which of the maternal gametophyte genes in Table 1 can be identified in Josh's Pteridium gametophyte transcriptome.
  * <a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esq021">doi:10.1093/jhered/esq021</a> expanatory pluralism = "the existence of a multitude of theories or explanations for a speciﬁc phenomenon".  Tangled bank hypothesis = the variability of sexual offspring provides an advantage over less variable asexual offspring because they can fill slightly different niches and compete with each other less. Mutational deterministic hypothesis = sexual reproduction purges deleterious mutations so efficiently it makes up for the costs of sex. Models seek to maximize generality, precision, and realism but typically only achieve 2 of the 3.  A basic assumption of modern science: The world consists of mathematically describable mechanisms but we can only observe the patterns these mechanisms generate in nature.
