NUSTLI is one of Todd Campbell's other professional development projects in its 3rd year.

Todd and I co-led an inquiry activity for this group of high school science teachers and content experts (USU researchers from Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics). Participants included Greg Podgorski (Biology) and Brad Davidson (Chemistry)

WE used the iSIT module 1 activity but did not incorporate the technology tools and stopped after they had planned their second round of inquiry. Â The sites we used were the Quad (only a single species found) and a weedy hillside along the parking lot across highway 89 from the new Agriculture Building (~10 species found).
