  * Talked to Hardeep Rai about adding a second T. intricatum to the GBS run (just using an old 1980's sample won't let me see whether issues are related to the age of the sample or something specific to the taxon, and having two lets me see how much variablity I can expect).
      * He says plan on yes for now and he will let me know if it isn't possible
      * He asked that I try to find any info I can that will allow us to estimate the genome size (to avoid swamping issues)
  * Worked with Colton Grisham on his VPGsim simulations.  He was in the group that is trying to simulate africanized bee invasions but his partner (who was driving that decision) dropped the class.  We worked out a simplified version of what they had planned and he started running the experiments.
