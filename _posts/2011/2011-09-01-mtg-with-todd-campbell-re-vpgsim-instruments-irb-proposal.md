Research questions:

  1. Does the intervention (using the VPGsim system as part of an inquiry activity) improve students' content understanding?
  2. Does the intervention improve confidence in students' ability to do inquiry?
  3. Is there correlation between students' confidence in their ability to do inquiry and their actual ability to do inquiry?

Notes:

  * 2-3 page proposal, not as rigorous as a scientific proposal but with enough background info/citations to show that it is grounded in the literature and that we are serious about the study
  * Use Robin Nagy's (Todd's student) student confidence rubric as a pre and post assessment to look at research question #2 and provide part of the data needed for research question #3
  * Use Robin's inquiry rubric as a post-assessment when grading the students' reports as the other part of the data needed for research question #3 (pre and post would be better but we don't have any other assignment to use)
  * Write a set of open-ended questions that get at whether students are able to make the connection between interactions between individuals and their environment and the patterns that we see at the population level over longer time periods. Â Use these as a pre and post assessment to address research question #1
  * Write the assignment description for the lab report in a way that it draws out the items we are looking for in the inquiry rubric
  * Robin's rubrics are not published so we need to acknowledge that it is a tool just being developed and cite the material it is based on (the same things Robin cites in the rubric description.
  * Include citations from Duncan & Tseng's work on the layers of student understanding
  * Include citations on benefits of learning with simulations and interactive visualizations, and of 3D immersive environments
