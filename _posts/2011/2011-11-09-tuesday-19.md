  * ScienceSim senate meeting - short, no Mic or Jonathan and nothing to discuss.  Didn't bother posting minutes to wiki.
  * Talked to Hardeep about Trichomanes intricatum genome size.
  * Took T. intricatum samples to Hardeep for GBS pre-processing (since I will be out of town tomorrow when he is running them).
      * 07033 -  500ng/uL
      * F82-1-6-3 (extraction B) - 52.3 ng/uL
  * Tried to run git bisect on Opensim to track down why the Cellular Automata stopped working smoothly between Aug 3 and Nov 1, but couldn't get a standalone working that I could log into.  Notes in mantis suggest there was a problem with standalones for a while so I need to set up the git bisect on a region attached to ScienceSim.
  * Emailed Josh Der asking about the status of PECS (Putative Edit Classification Script).  Last I knew, I had the script working and just needed a dataset to test it on.  Josh was working on getting the dataset together (May 24, 2011 email).
  * Showed Paul Wolf how to use Qubit to quantify his PCR samples from BIOL3065.
