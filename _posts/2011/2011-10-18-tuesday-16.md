  * Sciencesim Senate mtg - Mic Bowman recommended looking at the viewdistance setting on my vpgsim regions.  If I have it set higher than 512 then non-adjacent regions COULD effect each other like I am seeing.  I know I didn't intentionally change that but perhaps I was playing with that months ago and copied it forward into these regions?
  * Hardeep Rai is assembling another GBS run.  I can include a filmy.  I  need 150ng of DNA at 50ng/uL concentration.  This will be easiest to get from live tissue but I really want to know if GBS will work on preserved tissue so I will use one of Farrar's collections from the 1980's.
  * What fern DNA's do we have left over from the last sequencing run that we might be able to send to Ken Karol?
  * Experimented with how to clean tissue in preparation for DNA extraction.  I have a dime-sized chunk of tissue cleaned and ready.  This will likely not be enough to get the DNA I need but provides enough to test extraction and find out how much tissue I need to start with.
