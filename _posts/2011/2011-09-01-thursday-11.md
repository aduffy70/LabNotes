<a href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001137">doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001137</a>Apicomplexans (the group of organisms that includes the Plasmodium parasites, which cause malaria) retain a chloroplast-like organelle even though they aren't photosynthetic.  It turns out this organelle is performing just 1 critical function for the organism - it produces IPP a precursor of a group of compounds that includes things like rubber and cholesterol.  When they raise parasites in an IPP-rich environment the plastids and their genome (and the cost to the cell of replicating and maintaining the plastid) are eventually lost.
