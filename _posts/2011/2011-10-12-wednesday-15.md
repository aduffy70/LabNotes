  * Watered gametophyte cultures and refilled humidity tanks.  Didn't water the big jars of Alaskan Hymenophyllum wrightii since they were overwatered last week and are still moist.
  * Prep for VPGsim activity in Biol3065.  Shutdown all regions, deleted OpenSim.log for all, lowered maximum population size from 10k to 8k for all, restarted regions.
  * Wrote Assignment description for VPGsim activity report and posted it to the course webpage
  * Set up a cron job on transcriptome to write the output of top to a web-accessible file every 10 minutes so I can easily watch for frozen regions.
