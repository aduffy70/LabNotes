Module 1 PD wrap-up and feedback:

  * We need to give paper copies of the tutorials because the people who most need them can't locate them online
  * If we give the teachers advanced warning, they could come to next summer's PD prepared to give a presentation on an inquiry activity they did (other than our modules)

Module 2 discussion:

  * Need a shared spreadsheet document where groups in a class can record the data from their scale measurements. Each group will be measuring the same 3 or 4 objects on ramps of the same 4 (3 ramps and 1 vertical measurement).  We want the data for all the groups for each object to be easily compared so they can see where there are discrepancies been their measurements.  Make a google docs template the teachers can use to create this for their classes.
  * Look into browser-based presentation creation or video editing tools (prezi, stop-action software, etc)
