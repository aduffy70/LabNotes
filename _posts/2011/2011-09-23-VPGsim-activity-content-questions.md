  * Talked to Paul Wolf about content questions for the VPGsim activity.  He recommends dropping question #3 since the questions will take a long time to answer and that one is least related to the things I am hoping to achieve with this intervention.  Need to double-check with Todd Campbell, but just eliminating a question should not be a big deal.
