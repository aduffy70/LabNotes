I created a database application to store the results of the first round of inquiry in the DRK12 module 1.  The tool is built on Google AppEngine and utilizes the Google Charts API.

Students can record:

  * School
  * Teacher
  * Month
  * Year
  * Human impact rating (on a 0-10 scale with 0 being no human impact)
  * Number of species found
  * Area of the sampled plots
  * Description of the site

Students can apply filters to display only subsets of the data in the database and view a plot of the results. This could be used as another source of data in rounds 2-3 of the inquiry activity or just as a way of putting the data from their sites into a larger context. We shared this tool with the teachers and linked it to the iSIT website.

  * The site is available at <http://diversitydb.appspot.com>
  * The source code is at <https://github.com/aduffy70/diversitydb>
