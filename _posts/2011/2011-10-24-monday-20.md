  * Prepared fern DNA samples to ship to Ken Karol for 454 sequencing and gave them to Paul Wolf.
  * Transferred or shutdown everything on my aduffy70.org domain (I let it expire and cancelled it with GoDaddy).
  * Talked to Michael Orr about PCR and showed him where to get the reagents and equipment for the BIOL3065 class.
  * Deleted plants on region 13 for their bottleneck test
  * Talked to students on VPGsim5 about ways to control their population size. Â They were on the Mt Logan terrain and it was getting big. It ended up crashing but they got the data they needed out of it
