  * Skipped ScienceSim senate mtg. Open Metaverse Foundation (OMF) representatives will not be there and there is nothing further I can do to help improve the User, Region Owner, and Grid Provider agreements.  There is no point to this meeting until we get OMF actively involved. If it doesn't happen soon I expect Intel may just shut ScienceSim down.
  * Reading related to Genetics lab activity IRB proposal:
