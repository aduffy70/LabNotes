  <ol>
    <li>
      Reminded class of the experiment we set up last week and what we were trying to test
    </li>
    <li>
      Broke into groups to compare plots from their population to the original population while Michael Orr and I walked around asking questions and probing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Had groups explain to the class what they found in their experiment
    </li>
    <li>
      Broke into groups to come up with ideas for a next experiment.  My plan was that each group would try to find 2-3 ideas and share the ideas with the class.  That way groups who struggled to find ideas might use an idea from another group.  The reality was that each group had one or more good ideas and they'd basically settled on an idea before the time was up and were working out how to set up the experiment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Had each group explain their idea to the class and the class got to ask 2 questions (with no defense required).
    </li>
    <li>
      Explained the proposal assignment requirements and expectations and gave the groups time to work out their plan so they could each go home and write a proposal.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div>
  We finished an hour early but I felt like we covered everything I'd hoped and groups left with a clear idea of their experiments.  Some groups were even running test experiments to see if their ideas were feasible or to help choose parameter values to use.

  Ideas that students chose to investigate:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How does the density of a starting population affect things?
    </li>
    <li>
      Genetic tradeoffs (1 gene controls two traits that affect fitness in opposite ways OR two genes control two traits that affect fitness in opposite ways)
    </li>
    <li>
      Population bottlenecks (start a population, let it stabilize, kill off all plants not in a preselected area and let it stabilize again).
    </li>
    <li>
      Effects of altitude (groups looking at different altitude optimums and different fitness curve shapes and how that effects patterns of diversity and heterozygosity levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      Looking at patterns that emerge if we have two different selective gradients.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I told them they are welcome to try to start running simulations now but that if things crash, they crash.  Next week I will start keeping a 2-day restart schedule so they can plan for it.
