  * Created a [Google Docs-based PCR setup sheet][1] for the BIOL3065 course, shared it with anyone with the link and emailed the link to Paul Wolf and Michael Orr.
  * Restarted 3 VPGsim regions (2,5, & 9) when they shot out of control.  One had only 20 generations but had ramped to \>8k plants while the other 2 had more reasonably sized populations with 300+ generations each.  These were the only restarts I had to do this weekend.
