  * Talked to Paul Wolf about flow cytometry to estimate genome sizes/ploidy levels in T.intricatum.  Karen Mock will be running flow cytometry soon and is willing to include a few samples, but I will need to find my own calibration samples (since her Aspen are too far diverged).  Paul recommends finding 3 ferns that have known chromosome counts/genome sizes on the Kew Gardens site that we also have tissue for in the greenhouse.  As an alternative, Ebihara & Nitta have known sizes and counts for some of their Trichomanes minutum samples and I could ask for tissue samples - perhaps in exchange for running some other samples for them.
