  * Make the system work for a single region.  Adding complexity so we can have multiple regions creates problems.
  * Make the system work from a blank startup.  We can't restart populations so setting things up based on wanting to be able to start from an existing population is not useful.  Same thing for loading populations from an oar file.
  * We need a kill button because students don't have the authority to delete objects.  To apply selection manually or to manually generate a population bottleneck, they need a way to kill a living plant on demand.  After manually deleting plants for 3 groups, I think even a kill button will not work (though it would be useful at other times).  It will take far too long to kill plants one at a time.  Maybe an 'artificial selection' form that lets them select by genotype, haplotype, allele at a locus, range of locations, or something.
  * I NEED a viewer that doesn't allow certain operations.  No building.  No planting Linden plants.  No editing avatars.  No doing anything that isn't directly related to the simulation.
  * Need a way for the students to be able to see (or even reload on the parameters form) the parameters they are using.
  * I need to be able to contact students - when I assign a region, I need to get a contact email so I don't have to wait for them to contact me before I can offer guidance.
