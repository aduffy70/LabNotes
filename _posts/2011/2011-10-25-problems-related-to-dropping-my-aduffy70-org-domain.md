  * Had to manually re-url my elab notebook site and manually relink all photos in posts
  * Gnome-Do still insists on trying the old elab url when I launch the Chrome app - and it isn't finding my Firefox shortcuts (the firefox issue is because of switching to firefox7.  It is a bug in the Gnome-Do plugin so I've moved back to Kupfer - which solves the other problem too).
  * Quicksilver  is still finding the safari shortcuts (or chrome?) for tasklist, notepad and other things that were on that domain.
  * There are some manually created links in some posts that still point to the old domain.  The good news is, searching the site for 'aduffy70' finds these easily.
