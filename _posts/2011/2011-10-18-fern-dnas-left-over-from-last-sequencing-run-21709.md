This is what is left of the samples we sent for the last sequencing run on 2/17/09:

| Sample | Conc (ng/uL) | uL sent | ug sent | remaining here |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Bracken#156 | 1000 | 25 | 25.0 | 50uL |
| Bracken#157 | 300 | 85 | 25.5 | 15uL |
| Lygodium#162 | 500 | 50 | 25.0 | 40uL (plus ~50uL @25ng/uL) |
| Crepidomanes#179 | 500 | 50 | 25.0 | 450uL (plus ~40uL @25ng/uL) |
| Crepidomanes#182 | 300 | 85 | 25.5 | 500uL (plus another 50uL @ same conc) |
| Vandenboschia#177 | 150 | 170 | 25.5 | 65uL |
| Gleichenia '793' | 300 | 85 | 25.5 | 50uL |

For some of these, it looks like they sent back the leftovers from the material we sent last time.  They need 5ug and we sent 25ug of each so that makes sense.  We don't need the bracken this time (we have lots of bracken data including a full cpGenome) and we only need one of the Crepidomanes.
