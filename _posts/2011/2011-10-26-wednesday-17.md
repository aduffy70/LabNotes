  * Ran minigel for Trichomanes intricatum extractions for GBS & quantified on Qubit - Tube B is over 50ng/uL and has much more than the 150ng total DNA that I need for GBS.
  * Preserved half of the Alaskan Hymenophyllum wrightii samples from large jars in silica gel.Â  They are struggling so I want to save as much tissue as possible before it is too late.
