  * This went about as well as yesterday.  Student ideas include:
      * Looking a disperal of unique subpopulation markers between islands
      * Looking at effects of whether a trait is dominant or recessive on how quickly it goes to fixation
      * Looking at tradeoffs between traits controlled by the same or separate genes
      * Looking at hybrid zone interactions on an altitude gradient
      * One group is playing with the life cycle settings to try to approximate an ant reproductive system to look at gene flow between subspecies of ants
  * I agreed to create a new terrain for one group - a set of 4 equally spaced islands in a square with a combined area equal to the one large 80X80 island.  Once it is available I told them I would post the command to load it on the class website.
