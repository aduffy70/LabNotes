  * [doi:10.1073/pnas.1100404108][2] Geneflow into populations at the range limit can increase diversity, increasing fitness, but it can also introduce maladaptive genes, reducing fitness.  So the best situation is geneflow from other populations at the same range limit rather than from populations in the center or at other limits.

  * [doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03794.x][3] Dating major divergences in landplants

  * [doi:doi.org/10.1640/0002-8444-101.2.57][4] Cheilanthes sporophytes are well adapted to dry environments, but how do the gametophytes do it?  By controlling osmosis through production of lipids and carbohydrates.  But these are produced gradually so young gametophytes can only survive in moist environments like any other fern gametophyte.  It seems Cheilanthes habitat tolerance is limited by the gametophyte stage, and particularly early in the gametophyte development.
