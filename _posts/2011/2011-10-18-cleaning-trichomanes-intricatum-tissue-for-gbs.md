Cleaning tissue to preparing for extractions for Hardeep Rai's GBS run.

Sample: Farrar 82-1-6-3

(chosen because it is very old -1982- so it tests GBS on a worst-case sample and because there is a lot of it so I can experiment with cleaning methods and extraction protocols)

  1. Started with a dime-sized piece of tissue backed by thick sand but with few visible organic contaminants
  2. In a weigh dish, with tweezers, picked off largest chunks of sand
  3. Held tissue with tweezers and sprayed with ddH2O from a squirt bottle to wash away more sand
  4. With two pairs of tweezers, gently picked out sand chunks and gently crushed chunks entwined in the tissue
  5. Swirled to wash away remaining sand and to recapture stray bits of tissue floating in the dish
  6. Inspect tissue @ 20X magnification for remaining contaminants (organic or sand)
  7. Placed in 2mL tube on ice.
  8. Wicked excess moisture out of tube with a Kimwipe and stored sample in -20 freezer.
