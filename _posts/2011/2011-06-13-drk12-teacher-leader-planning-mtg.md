Classroom observer comments:

  * Don't just DO the activities... It is important to write down predictions, hypotheses, etc.

Comments from Jana's 2nd pilot:

  * Integrating \*the students'\* technology into the activity causes complication - each student is now using slightly different technology and even though they know how to use it they don't necessarily know how to transfer between the school supplied technology (e.g. students taking pictures on their own phone)
  * Teachers need to do some prep to make sure they know where the students will be able to collect data.  THis may involve getting permissions from admins or property owners so plan in advance.
  * This could be a good activity at the begining of the year.
  * Do we provide a bulleted list of suggestions for the teachers of things to keep in mind to make this go smoothly - or do we have them produce that list during the PD? Have a discussion during the PD where they come up with ideas for how they can make this work.
  * We need to provide good tutorials (what we have is a great start) to the students so the teachers have some support in helping the students use the technology.

IPhone apps with potential for use as 'probes':

  * Look up Sten Kaiser's seeLevel,  sprintTimer, swingTool, speedClock

Comments from Module 1 Assessment:

  * Glossary of terms at the end of the module... terms such as 'ICT', 'iteration', etc.
  * During the PD have the teachers make the list of ways that the activity connects to other standards.  We need to get them invested in the process.  Instead of us making a list of questions to ask or to guide the students toward, let's have the teachers generate those questions.
  * Teachers in the PD need to write a script for Paul's introductory video.

Key elements of PD for 8th grade teachers:

  * Variety (short attention span theater) & produce a product
  * large group - small group - large group
  * Applicable to their lives
  * Don't let them use anecdotal war-stories to waste time and nay-say.  We want to push you beyond your own experiences        If you won't try to change the way you think about this how do you expect your kids to change their thinking        Don't let the one bad class or one bad student stop us from doing what we know we should be doing
  * Provide appropriate time for reading we expect them to do
  * Good food/breaks (enforce break times and model good time usage)

PD plan discussion:

  * Starting with BFSI is not going to get people excited to start the 9 days of PD - start with the first outside data collection activity.
  * WHat if students come up with questions that would require some basic processes or tools for the students to use?  THe teacher will have 36 kids and can't stop to explain to the students how to do things like looking at soil.  What if we provide a basic kit (or even just instructions) for a few of the things we can think of that might be needed?
  * Where do we put in using information resources (ICTs) into the module?
  * Even if everyone didn't do the homework, as long as someone in the group did it the discussion can still happen
  * Get the RTOP in the PD.  Teaching the students the core without ever telling them what the core is is... "dumb".  Expecting RTOP practices to happen without teaching them about RTOP is too.
