  * Module 3 is coming fast!  I need to get back on the programming.
  * We need to have a pilot of module 3, ideally with students at the same stage that we will be doing the activity: 8th graders early in the year.  So we need a pilot with that age group.  That would have to be done now.  Maybe we could use 7th graders late in the year?
