  * How to statistically compare two time series? This is not something that has a straightforward solution. If I think that the data are reasonably linear, I can do a comparison of the slopes. If I can fit them to a curve I can compare two curves, but only two at a time. As much as I hate to discard all the intermediate measurements, I think the best way to analyze the turkey weight data may be to just convert it to a single measurement (weight gained, or weight gained as a percentage of starting weight) and do a 2-way anova like all the CBC measurements.
