  * Emailed Ken Roberts @ Science Scope asking that if he won't/can't sign the permission to reprint letter for my dissertation (which he says is not necessary under the terms of their copyright agreement) then can he instead send me a copy of that agreement so I can include that in my dissertation. DONE- Ken returned the signed form. This is the last thing I was waiting on to be able to submit the dissertation.
