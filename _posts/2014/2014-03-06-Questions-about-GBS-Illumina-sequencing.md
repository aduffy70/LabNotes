  * Talked to Connie at Rockefeller University about getting the sequencing done.  Trying to explain to her what I need done raised doubts that I correctly understand that part of the process so I emailed Hardeep Rai to confirm two things:
    * Our adapters are designed to work with the standard Illumina read 1 primers. They don't need to do anything differently than if we'd used a standard illumina library prep kit.
    * The barcode doesn't need to be sequenced separately (so no "index" is needed)- and actually, the sequencing center doesn't need to know anything about the barcodes at all, since as far as they are concerned this is a single DNA sample.  We do the de-multiplexing bioinformatically when we get the sequence data back.
  * If I am correct about these two things then the process becomes very straightforward.  Fill out the sequencing request form (did it on the phone while talking to Connie), and email it to her along with written confirmation that I only need Illumina read 1 sequencing primers and that the barcode doesn't need to be sequenced separately.  Upon receipt of that she will reply with shipping instructions and we can arrange payment.
