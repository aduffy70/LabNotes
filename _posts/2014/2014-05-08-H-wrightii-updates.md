  * Emailed Warren Hauk to check on status of Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript in American Fern Journal.  He says it should have gone on to the managing editor but he will follow up
  * Emailed Lucy Stefanyk for guidance on the maps for the Hymenphyllum wrightii collection permits for Haida Gwaii. I'm not sure what maps to provide since I want to check likely sites all along the west coast and not at specific sites.  The 1:20,000 scale maps only make sense if I am interested in very specific sites.  I could provide the 1:350,000 map and indicate the general locations where plants have been found before.
