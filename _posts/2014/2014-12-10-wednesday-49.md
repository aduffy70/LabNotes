  * Responded to Don Hauber's questions about GBS data quality - updated exploreambiguous.py to work with any barcode length and wobble bases so I could run it on my dataset and figure out how it is possible to have barcodes 4 bases apart but still have reads ambiguously assigned to 2 barcodes with a distance of 2.
