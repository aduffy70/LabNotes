  * Signed dissertation coverpage from Todd Campbell arrived via USPS Priority at the Biology Dept today. I misunderstood the problem on the cover page- it wasn't the spacing after the department name, the department name should be on its own line. The new version I mailed to Todd has the same problem but Kami McNeil said it was acceptable to cut and tape sections of the signature page so we taped the fully signed section onto an updated version with the correct layout of the department name. Apparently, despite all the fuss over the need for all signatures to be original and in ink, it is acceptable to tape signatures in and in the end, the "officially signed" version doesn't even have to be the copy stored in the library - Any of the copies can go to the library and I can do whatever I want with the ink-signed version.
  * Did a final review of dissertation formatting, reprinted the coverpage and Chapter 5 (I fixed some inconsistencies in the punctuation I used in some of the heading levels and found another spot where I put a period outside quotation marks instead of inside), and delivered to the Assistant Dean at the School of Graduate Studies. They did not want the documents showing the formatting requirements - only the gray sheet showing the errors he found the first time, the signed department format approval form, and the reprinted dissertation. I also dropped off the Plans for Future publication form. All of it was stamped as recieved and recorded in a log.
  * Dropped off dissertation IRB form at the IRB office (on way home)
