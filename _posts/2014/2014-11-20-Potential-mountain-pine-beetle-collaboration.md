  * Talked to Karen Mock about the data analysis she is working on and would like assistance with: She and Mike Pfrender got a GBS dataset for mountain pine beetles from their habitat forming a horshoe around the Great Basin. Past studies (AFLPs) show that at the southern tips of the horseshoe the beetles are very different and form sterile F1 hybrids. There are also some interesting things going on in the Y sex chromosome with very different sets of genes being moved out of the chromosome between the two groups. They know enough about the genome that we can probably identify Y-chromosome reads from the GBS dataset (though anything found there is for a project spoken for by one of Karen's ex-students. She is looking for help evaluating the data quality and figuring out how to analyze it.
