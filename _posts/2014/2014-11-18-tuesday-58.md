Today:

  * Replied to Mary Stensvold (and Don Farrar) about the potential errors she identified on the Hymenophyllum wrightii manuscript proofs from the American Fern Journal, and let them know that if they have no other concerns I will email Warren Hauk tonight to approve the proofs.
  * Figure out if I can easily run a crossed-nested factorial analysis in R. If not, find a computer lab with SAS and run it there. - Crossed-nested factorial with unbalanced samples is outside my statistical ability, but I can do this as 2-way ANOVAs. Working to automate it in R.
  * My reviewed dissertation was delivered to the Biology office. Picked it up and discussed changes and next steps with Paul Wolf and Kami McNeil. Should be relatively quick changes, though it WILL require reprinting and getting new signatures on the title page.
