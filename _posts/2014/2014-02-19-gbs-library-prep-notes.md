Started a second page on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkDnkQIRAeIIdHg5YUwtZ2dSeXVxeUlNUzh1bGZsNFE&usp=drivesdk#gid=1" target="_blank">Trichomanes intricatum sample sheet in Google Drive </a>to track just the ones being used in this GBS run.

Labeled 54 0.7mL tubes to match the sample sheet (sample numbers 1-54 on the lid and collection ID/extraction date on the side.

Made 10ng/uL dilutions in the 0.7mL tubes. Â I need 10uL for the GBS run, but I made at least 30uL of each in case I need a second run at some point or need to do any testing of the DNA samples later. Did a double dilution of 07033 since I don't trust that it is really 500ng/uL and not just overwhelming the Qubit
