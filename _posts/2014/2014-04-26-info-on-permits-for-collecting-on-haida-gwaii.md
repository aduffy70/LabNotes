> Good day Aaron –
>
> Thank you for inquiring with Park Ranger Chris Ashurst about requirements to collect plants from protected areas on Haida Gwaii. I’ve attached the link to the Permit and Authorization Service Bureau as you will require the following:
>
>   · Research Park Use Permit to collect within Daawuuxusda Conservancy
>
>   · Research and Education Ecological Reserve Permit to collect within Vladimir J Krajina Ecological Reserve
>
> <http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/pasb/applications/process/park_use.html>
>
> Once you submit your application to the bureau it is forwarded back to Haida Gwaii for the Haida Nation/Provincial Solutions Table to review. There are no fees associated with research permits.
>
> Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions about the protected areas or permitting process.
