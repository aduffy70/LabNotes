  * Generated 2 types of venn/euler diagrams for Jake Weston's Lung Affymetrix data showing which genes are uniquely up-regulated in each treatment group or combination of groups. Even though the plain venn version isn't scaled based on the data, this particular dataset happens to fit the default area sizes well enough that it almost looks like it was scaled (with a few exceptions). The ChowRuskey plot has such irregularly shaped areas for this dataset that I think it is difficult to interpret. Interestingly, the majority of the up-regulated genes are unique to just one of the treatments. I would have expected many genes to be up-regulated in all treatments or at least for the two Diesel or two PM2.5 treatments to share many genes, or for the two high-level, or two low-level treatments to share many genes. Apparently the cells are responding in quite different ways to each of his four treatments.
