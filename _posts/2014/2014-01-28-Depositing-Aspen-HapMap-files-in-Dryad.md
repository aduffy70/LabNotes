After discussing with Martin Schilling what data we have and what would be needed to recreate our analysis I deposited the HapMap files (hmc & hmp).  I got the files from Martin's Github repo (uploaded 1/21/14).  Dryad assigned a provisional DOI:

> Data package title: Data from: Genotyping-by-sequencing for Populus population genomics: an assessment of genome sampling patterns and filtering approaches
Provisional DOI: doi:10.5061/dryad.2cs4g
Data files: HapMap.hmc.txt.tar
HapMap.hmp.txt.tar

To pay ($90 submission costs) I used Paul Wolf's 7257 card.  It won't actually bill until the curators have reviewed and approved the submission.
