# 1KP Conference

May 2014 at University of Florida Gainesville

<https://sites.google.com/site/1kp1n2n/>

  * “Reversal of Fortunes” (not sure who used this phrase - might be in the title of one of the 1KP papers but it refers to the switch in landplants from gametophyte-dominated to sporophyte-dominated lifecycles
  * SATe - iterative alignment and tree estimation
    * coalescent vs concatenation approaches. This software package came up several times as it is a part of the analysis pipelines being used in the project.  It replaces the old 2-step process of clustalw alignment, followed by tree estimation in PAML with an iterative loop of more and more refined alignments and tree estimations.
  * Sigma extraction kit - but use 1/4 the tissue they recommend. This is the RNA extraction kit Josh and others are using.
  * The idea that too much tissue in extractions actually leads to worse yields was repeated by both Peter and Josh.
  * Troubleshoot the process on abundant material (sporophyte) and it will likely work on smaller amounts (gametophytes)
  * glass microgrinders - Kimball Chase brand - reduced loss in grinding process. I think we have one of these in the lab.  The closely fitted glass tube and glass pestle break up cells better than plastic tubes with ill-fitting blue pestles
  * 20-50mg starting tissue is better than more tissue
  * Conserving these little known species because they might turn out to be valuable is a “religious belief” - Gane
  * dysploidy
  * H.D. Thoreau? “Nature made ferns for pure leaves to show what she could do in that line”
  * Barcode bleed-through on Illumina runs?
  * Fern genome discussion: Marsilea (800Mb?) or Ceratopteris (22Gb diploid) and Azolla (650Mb?)
    * Azolla has Nostoc symbiotic and doing it normally and Nostoc-free would be informative, and it has economic impacts
    * Ceratopteris is Ceratopteris
    * Marsilea has a small genome and interesting morphology
  * Sally Stevens is finishing her PhD working on Vittaria appalachiana. She looked at how they may be effected by climate change. She found sites north of the glaciation line and transplanted Vittaria into the area for a year to see whether they can survive there. It seems they can, so it would appear there is nothing environmental keeping them out, they just aren’t getting there. Her work nicely complements what I am doing with Trichomanes intricatum. She know how to find both Appalachian gametophytes and her family is from Kentucky, so she will probably occasionally be back where she can get fresh tissue.
