  * Meeting w/Paul Wolf, Carol Rowe, and Zach Gompert re: using GBS-like library prep technique to sequence specific fragments with known PCR primer sites. They want to do this to get all alleles of some specific nuclear genes from multiple fern species without cloning/sanger sequencing, but this sort of technique could be useful for getting sequence (and methylation patterns) from specific inter-GST regions in turkeys.
