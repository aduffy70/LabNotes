  * Talked about the quality analysis
  * Carol Rowe is looking at a method for her targeted-loci illumina sequencing that doesn't require using the M13 system and uses Illumina's standard indexing system to barcode the samples. Paul wants me to stay involved in that project since it overlaps with things I am doing.
  * I need to set up a meeting with Zach Gompert to talk about next steps in the analysis
  * At some point I need to blast against nr(?) to check for algal, fungal, and other contamination. After I assemble things into stacks so I'm making fewer queries?
