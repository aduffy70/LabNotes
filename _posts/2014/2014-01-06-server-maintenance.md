  * Moved cordate over to the UPS.  Also did system upgrades and checked VPCsim for functionality (including loading parameters from the webform and generating plots and logs). I took it down twice for less than 5 minutes each time (between noon and 12:30) so hopefully it didn't impact any users.
  * Upgraded plastid and tried to do gemmae but it was going to take hours to download the files.  I checked the network cable and it stopped working completely. Switched to a second cable and it still failed to connect, so I tore the stupid thing apart and tried adding secondary network cards with no success.  It was the cables! Both were bad.  Don't have another cable to reach to the side of the room by the UPS so gemmae is off the UPS and back over by the lab PC for now.
