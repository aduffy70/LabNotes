  * Need to save new GBS datasets to BigDisc (my data backup drive) but it isn't mounting properly in Ubuntu 14.04.
  * Check the md5 checksums of Trichomanes and Salvinia GBS datasets, put a backup copy on cordate(? or whichever machine I put the last Trichomanes datasets on) and let Zach Gompert know we have it backed up so he can delete it from his DoRC storage.
