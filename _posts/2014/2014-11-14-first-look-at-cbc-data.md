  * Walked through the Turkey CBC & Weight data with Jake Weston. They've (Deepika Gaddam & Jake) already run a bunch of statistical tests looking for differences between the domestic vs wild birds with control feed or AFB feed. I need to take a closer look at what comparisons and tests they've done:
      * Are the types of tests (t-tests and ANOVAs) appropriate for the experimental design?
      * Are the assumptions of the tests met?
      * Are there other things we can pull from the data?
