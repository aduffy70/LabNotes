  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">Meeting w/Paul Wolf, Carol Rowe, and Zach Gompert re: using GBS-like library prep technique to sequence specific fragments with known PCR primer sites. They want to do this to get all alleles of some specific nuclear genes from multiple fern species without cloning/sanger sequencing, but this sort of technique could be useful for getting sequence (and methylation patterns) from specific inter-GST regions in turkeys.</span>
  * Ran 2-way ANOVAs for 21 different turkey CBC, liver profile, and weight measurements. Looked at Type\*AFB treatment and Variety\*AFB treatment. Generated interaction plots, bar-whisker plots, and a summary of which measurements are significantly different for Types and Varieties. I also generated Normal Q-Q plots and residual plots to look for problems in the data but didn't see anything that screamed out at me.
