  * GBS sequencing is done and the data is ready.Â Download my Crepidomanes (gomp002) & and Don Hauber's Salvinia (gomp001) GBS data from University of Utah sequencing center.
      * One copy to GBS_11-24-2014/ on transcriptome
      * One copy to Data/GBS_11-24-2014 on crozier (outside the backup path).
      * Put a README file in both locations describing the files and referring to the protocol used to generate the libraries.
      * Need to save them to BigDisc (my data backup drive) but it isn't mounting properly in Ubuntu 14.04... need to fight that later.
      * Zach Gompert is also downloading them to the DoRC so there will be ample backups around.
