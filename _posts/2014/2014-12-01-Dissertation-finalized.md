  * Combined all dissertation pdfs into a single pdf file. Gave a copy to Kami for the Biology Dept and emailed one to Paul Wolf (he doesn't want a bound copy).
  * Pickup signed dissertation, make copies (one for me, one for Biology Dept, original for library), take to library, and pay binding fees
  * Returned binding receipt to the School of Graduate Studies!
