  * Checked with Kami McNeil about status of getting the I's on my transcript updated (the last step(???!) to complete my degree). She is doing it today and will push to get it processed ASAP. Once that is done, the grad school will attempt to process the degree and will notify us if there are any other things that need to be addressed. This all needs to be completed by Friday (Dec 12) for the degree to post this semester and so I won't have to re-validate any other courses.
