  * Shoot for early to mid april defense
  * Need to check with Cami that paperwork is in order
  * Talk to Zach Gompert about ideas of where to send Trichomanes intricatum samples for GBS sequencing.
  * Get Aspen GBS data submitted and an accession #.  See if Zach knows tricks for automating this.  Do we submit the barcode-sorted reads?  Ideally we want just one accession number to refer to rather than one for each of the 140ish samples
  * Priorities:
      * Get GBS sent off - there may be a couple month backlog!
      * While waiting on GBS get with Todd to finish the chapter on VPGsim Genetics Lab activity
