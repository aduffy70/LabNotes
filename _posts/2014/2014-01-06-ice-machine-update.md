  * Checked new pump on freezer by pouring water into it and verifying that it runs and drains without leaking.  Looks like the AC guys or the plumbers adjusted the pressure coming into the ice machine and that solved the leaking through the intake shutoff valve.  Floor behind and under ice machine is completely dry for the first time since I've been here.
