Lab meeting @10
  * Roger, Jake, Sean, Deepika, Fran
  * I need to get the body weight etc. data for statistical analysis - what have they already done with it?
  * See what kind of targeted methylation analysis kits are available. We already have primers for the intergenic areas surrounding some of the GSTs so we could potentially use those same primers to look at methylation patterns in those areas (which are likely where expression promoters are located).
  * Deepika has been looking at SNPs in those intergenic areas and wants to do high throughput sequencing as well. What are we trying to achieve with that? Fill in the ~15-20% of those areas that she was not able to sequence?
