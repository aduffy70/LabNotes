  * Ran 2-way ANOVAs for 21 different turkey CBC, liver profile, and weight measurements. Looked at Type\*AFB treatment and Variety\*AFB treatment. Generated interaction plots, bar-whisker plots, and a summary of which measurements are significantly different for Types and Varieties. I also generated Normal Q-Q plots and residual plots to look for problems in the data but didn't see anything that screamed out at me.
