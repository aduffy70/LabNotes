  * Emailed Zach Gompert to ask if the results I am getting from cutadapt are comparable to what he has seen. On my Crepidomanes GBS dataset, cutadapt found Illumina adapter sequence in 37% of my reads and trimmed 12% of my total bases. On Don's Salvinia GBS dataset the adapter was in ~25% of the reads and trimmed ~8% of the total bases. This would suggest we have many reads that are shorter than what we expected based on the range we filtered at the BluePippin. He says that is not expected and will let me know what he finds in the data from the libraries he prepared at the same time.
