  * Did a final review of dissertation looking for other examples of the formatting issues identified by the reviewer at the grad school. Found an example article from the American Journal of Botany showing their preferred format for citing dissertations so I can include that with the other style guides when I return the dissertation for the second round of review. Printed out a new copy at the Department of Biology. Made two copies of the cover sheet since I need to get signatures from my committee again (spacing issue). Got signatures from Jim Powell and Zach Gompert but need to try again to find Paul Wolf (who will also sign for Todd Campbell in Connecticut) and Karen Mock.
