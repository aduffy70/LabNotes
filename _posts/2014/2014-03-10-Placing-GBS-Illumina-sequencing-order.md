  * Confirmed GBS sequencing questions with Hardeep Rai. Â As far as the sequencing center is concerned, our library is a standard Illumina library to be sequenced with the standard primers and it is a single sample - they don't need any info about the barcodes.
  * Got Pcard info from Jennifer Schultz.
