  * Got Paul Wolf and Karen Mock signatures on new dissertation coversheets.
  * Found out from Kami McNeil that Paul's "on behalf of Todd Campbell" signature will NOT be accepted by the grad school. Sent 2 copies of the cover page (Fedex overnight on Paul's account) to Todd's home in Dartmouth (after confirming his address and that he will be there tomorrow). He will sign and return ASAP. This is the last thing I need before I can resubmit my dissertation to the graduate school.
