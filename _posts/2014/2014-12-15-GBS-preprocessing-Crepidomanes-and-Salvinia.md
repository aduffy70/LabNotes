  * Crepidomanes data:
    * What happened with the second cutadapt run? It looks like I could have filtered for a longer range of readlengths on the BluePippen when I generated the library. 37% of my reads had at least part of the adapter at the end, and a whopping 12% of my bases got trimmed! (25% and 7% for Don's data)
    * Quality filter data and start stacking reads
  * What support does Don Hauber need to continue analyzing his Salvinia data? He will be trying to run the same analyses I am at least at the start, so finish correcting, trimming, and cutting adapters from his reads. He wants to use all the exact matches and distance=1 reads.
