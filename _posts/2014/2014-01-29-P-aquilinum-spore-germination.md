  * Made Bold's Mineral Nutrient Medium in preparation for germinating S48 Pteridium aquilinum spores for Paul Wolf.
      * We had all macronutrients in the lab except K2HPO4 and NaNO3, both of which I was able to get from Kendal Morris.
      * Mixed only 100mL of each macronutrient stock and only 500mL of the micronutrient stock (since we will never use them all anyway)
      * Made 1L of the Macronutrient + Micronutrient stock
  * Solidified 100mL of final medum with 0.7% agar (700mg bactoagar in 100mL medium and poured into 5 petri dishes.
  * Sowed S48 (from Sheffield) spores onto 2 plates.  Used the glassine envelope "pepper shaker" method to keep them from clumping together.  Paul recommended sowing fairly heavily since those spores are old.  Placed them in my growth chamber on the top shelf directly under the autocycling lights.
