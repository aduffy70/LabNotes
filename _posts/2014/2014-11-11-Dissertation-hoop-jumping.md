  * Need to fill out Rights To Publication Form with Paul and get committee signatures.
  * Completed the Exempt Research Status report in the IRB forms (We had Exempt certification 09/23/2011 for protocol #4034). I don't need the 2nd IRB form (IRB Protocol Status Report) because we did not have Expedite Approval.
  * Checked with Kami on some dissertation questions:
      * The copy that goes to the Assistant Dean for review is printed.
      * The copy that goes to the library is both electronic and printed
      * The department wants an electronic copy and a bound copy when this is done
      * Check whether Paul wants a bound copy
      * Library gets a bound copy and then I can pay for whatever copies I want.
      * Paul is the Department Style Reviewer
  * Got Paul's signature on the copyright form and publication plans form. Still need the rest of the committee to sign the publications plan form and for Paul to sign off on the Style now that I know he is the reviewer.
