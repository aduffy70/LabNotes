Discussion w/Deepika Gaddam:

  * Hardeep Rai designed multiple overlapping primer pairs for the intergenic regions from ICK-GSTA4, GSTA4-GSTA3, and GSTA3-GSTA2.
  * Deepika has sanger sequenced most (~80%) of those regions at a low depth of coverage. She would like to use high throughput sequencing (ION) to get better coverage and hopefully fill in the remaining 20%.
  * Why are the 20% not sequencing with Sanger? Is it likely that HTS will help?
  * HTS will give deeper coverage of the 80% which will improve our confidence in SNP calls
  * HTS will give MUCH deeper coverage than is necessary, so could we include bi-sulfite treated (or other method) DNA for the same regions in the same library and also get methylation data at the same time we get SNP data?
  * Can we design primers (or do they exist) for the GSTA sequences and get data for those as well - all in one library?

ICK ...... 5828bp ..... GSTA4 .... 11774bp ...... GSTA3 ..... 8517bp ...... GSTA2

Total region (including coding sequences and introns = 57629
