  * Emailed Hardeep Rai asking about a protocol for GBS library prep since I will be using the same process, primers, labels, etc as he did with the aspen and the first 2 of my Trichomanes intricatum samples.
  * Sequencing options for GBS. Â I want Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 100bp single-end indexing runs like we did for the aspen manuscript:
    * University of Utah <http://bioserver.hci.utah.edu/BioInfo/index.php/Sequencing>
      * Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencing 101 cycle Single End Read Sequencing
      * per lane $1650.00
      * Emailed Brian Dalley to ask about timing and costs since we would do the library prep here
    * University of Texas Austin <https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Pricing#Pricing-seqprices>
      * Illumina HiSeq 2500 SR 1X100 H.O.
      * One lane $1,640.45
      * Emailed Randy Hughes to ask about timing and costs
