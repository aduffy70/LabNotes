Daniel Mosquin d.mosquin@gmail.com

Carl Rothfels put me in touch with him, since he has done work in Haida Gwaii.

# Notes from call with Daniel:

  * He has worked on the northeast corner of Graham Island.
  * Chris Ashurst chris.ashhurst@gmail.com is the ranger on Haida Gwaii and along with one of his colleagues is the contact for any non-federal land permits.  He will also know the process for working with the First Nations.
  * Krajina Preserve will be very difficult to reach.  Perhaps only 10 people a year visit. The other Graham Island sites are more readily accessible but a charter boat or floatplane will be required.
  * Daniel knows bird researcher that have used water taxis on the islands and will put me in touch with them for recommendations.
  * Make all arrangements before arriving.  Things move slowly and 'happen when they happen' and sport fishermen will be trying to book the same boats.
  * Arrive at Sandspit by ferry from Prince Rupert or directly from Vancouver by plane - costs will be similar.
  * "Find someone in Sandspit" to take you to the water taxi service to Queen Charlotte ('European town') or Skidegate ('Native town'). Base out of one of those towns since those are where the charter boat services run from.  There is nothing in Sandspit.

# Discussion with Paul Wolf:

  * Try to make the trip in the first couple weeks of August. If I can do it then, he will come along.
  * See if Mary Stensvold is interested in joining the trip.
  * Figure out logistics and costs - he should be able to find some travel funding
