Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol.  Exceptions/notes:

  * Made 10mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc
      * Use CTAB buffer from 10/7/13
      * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
      * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608
  * Ground using blue pestles in 1.5mL tubes, my plugin drill (to avoid battery limitations.  It spins faster but works fine.).  Held the tube in my wooden tube rack clamped to the bench in a tub of ice.
      * Applied force in an up and down bouncing and circular motion to avoid heating the plastic (it squeaks if you start to warm up).
      * Added 200uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 100 strokes
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 200uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc
      * Ground 100 strokes
      * Scraped the pellet up from the tip and into reach of the pestle and added 100uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc (500uL total)
      * Ground 100 strokes
  * Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock from between 10:30 & 11:30am until 7pm

Continued at 7pm on same day

  * Used 24:1 cloroform:isoamyl from 11/19/13
  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 20 minutes at 13000rpm in the accuSpin Micro centrifuge
  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
      * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 375uL, 30uL, 219uL except 07013 & 07035 (they were "scummy so I couldn't get as much aqueous layer): 200uL, 16uL, 117uL
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 7:45pm
  * Trying a double extraction on 07013 and 07035 since the layers don't seem to have separated correctly:
      * Added 150uL fresh CTAB+PVP+Bmerc to the chloroform and debris layers of each tube and vortexed.
      * Incubated overnight at 55C.  Started at 8pm.

Continued 01/08/14

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">For the double extractions, added another 150uL chloroform:isoamyl, muxed by hand shaking and spun as before. Aqueous 150uL, AmAcet. 12uL, Isoprop. 87.5uL.  Added these to the first extraction already in the freezer at 9am.</span>

  * Removed from freezer at 10:00am
  * Used 70% EtOH from 10/31/12 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator

Large visible pellets in all but 07035 (no surprise there)
