Hypotheses of parentage for polyploid Section Sphagnum based on assigning each of 14 haploid species to groups in STRUCTURE and asking it to find group proportions for the polyploid samples:
  * _Sphagnum papillosum_ = "S. affine1" x _S. magellanicum_
  * _Sphagnum alaskense_ = _S. imbricatum_ x _S. divinum_
  * _Sphagnum frahmii_ = _S. perichaetiale_ x _S. magellanicum_
  * _Sphagnum centrale_ = "S. affine2" x _S. divinum_
  * _Sphagnum palustre_ = "S. affine2" x _S. magellanicum_ except the Japanese samples also have some _S. divinum_ genetics and Thailand samples also have some _S. perichaetiale_ genetics??

Note- "S. affine1" and "S. affine2" refer to the "upper" and "lower" clades in my Section Sphagnum ML trees--species names to be determined.
