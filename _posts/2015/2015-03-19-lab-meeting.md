  * Lab meeting
      * Shared plan for final Lung Affymetrix dataset
      * Roger Coulombe needs a short summary to share with collaborators. Worked with Deepika Gaddam to create powerpoint slides of her expression bargraphs (which I still think are misleading and should be left out), the ANOVA interaction effects summary, and interaction plots (for Type and Variety) for Nrf2 and GSTA3 (as representative of all GSTAs).
      * Since I have a good mRNA sequence for GSTA4, I should go ahead with miRNA target analysis on that one gene. That way I can produce something potentially useful now rather than waiting til I've put together good mRNA sequences for the other GSTAs (which have a lot of variation in the sequences from different sources).
