  * Met with Paul to discuss Crepidomanes GBS and DRK12 manuscript
      * What I am doing now will work for the Washington DC conference - focus on the homozygous loci for the analysis. If these are really haploids those loci are the only ones that are clustered correctly. If they are diploids then using only these loci is filtering conservatively.
      * For the bigger picture analysis, I need to step back and look at the clustering step and haplotype/genotype calling steps again. Perhaps do the clustering from an assumption of complete haploidy and again from an assumption of complete diploidy and see which process yields results that make most sense.
      * We put out an email to people working on bryophytes to see if anyone is doing GBS/RADseq work in haploids that might be useful.
