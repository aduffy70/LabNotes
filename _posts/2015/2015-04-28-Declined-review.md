  * Declined a review request for manuscript #4760 from Biodiversity Data Journal. I'm no more qualified than anyone else with a glossary of botanical terms and undergraduate-level statistics. I checked with Paul Wolf to verify that it was not something he had recommended be sent to me. It came through Pensoft, so I'm likely just getting requests now that I'm in their system from PhytoKeys.
