Max Longhurst, Todd Campbell, Paul Wolf, Dan Coster (and Dan's student whose name I missed)

  * Working on a manuscript using the data from the first 2 years.
  * We can show that student outcomes improved for teachers that participated in the PD vs teachers that didn't
  * We can show that the improvement is stepwise over the 2 years of PD. Their students improved after the first year but the improvement was even greater after the second year.
