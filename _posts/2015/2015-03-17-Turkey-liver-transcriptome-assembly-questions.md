  * What am I actually trying to accomplish with the turkey liver transcriptome assembly data?
    * I don't need it to identify GSTA mRNA sequences (for the UTRs) since I can get those from Kim2010.
    * It isn't useful for looking at expression levels (since it is the combined assembly) and Monson/Reed did that already anyway.
    * It isn't useful for finding miRNAs - or at least not mature miRNAs - since short sequences were filtered. I could get those from the raw data in the SRA, but I need to figure out how.
