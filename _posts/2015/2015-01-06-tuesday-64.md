  * Drop off Wolf lab key with Zach Gompert (orÂ Samridhi in BNR 301). Samridhi wasn't around but I left it with Zach Valois. It is labeled with my name and the lab room number on red tape.
  * Next steps on Crepidomanes GBS data
      * Rerun cutadapt on trimmed data now that I've fixed the problem with part of the sticky end being stored with the barcode
      * Rerun removeemptysequences.py
  * Meeting w/Karen Mock to discuss next steps in her Pine Beetle analysis
