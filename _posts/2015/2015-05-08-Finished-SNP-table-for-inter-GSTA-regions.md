  * Finished SNP table for Inter-GSTA regions
      * Deepika Gaddam provided additional info on which turkey variety each sample represents:
          * BR (Bourbon Red), RP (Royal Palm), and SB (Standard Bronze) are heritage varieties
          * M (Moroni) is definitely Nicholas. She thinks G is as well. It is definitely a domestic variety and she doesn't think we sequenced any BB white so it must be Nicholas. The alleles present in G and M suggest they are probably the same thing as well.
          * She thinks the E sequences are actually EW (Eastern White). The alleles don't seem to rule that out (though they aren't as similar as the G and N were to each other).
      * We don't have great coverage of the 3'UTRs (where we'd most expect to find miRNA targets) because the primers were designed with a focus on the 5'UTR. Also we don't have the entire 5'UTR for all regions/varieties so additional primers are needed. Including BB white would be valuable since we are focusing our future efforts on BB white rather than Nicholas. We could get the additional sequence we need in a couple Sanger runs - we don't need nearly as many replicates and I don't think we need to focus on the heritage varieties.
