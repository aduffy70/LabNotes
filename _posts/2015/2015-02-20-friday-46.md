  * Lung Affymetrix data- Roger Coulombe recommended contacting the Affymetrix rep to see if she suggests rerunning just the control chips or the entire analysis. Prepared an email with Jake Weston with images showing the bad MA plot for C1 and the variable Controls for Helene Galang at Affymetrix.
  * Jeff Hill (Idaho State University) seminar. He presented his [AMOEBA project][1] where they are using actve inquiry activities as a replacement for the introductory biology series for honors students. The system involves faculty and graduate students acting as mentors for groups working on projects relating to their area of expertise. Undergraduates who have completed the course are also participating as mentors in subsequent semesters.
      * "My textbook is the NPR website."
      * Current projects are designed to fit into the Biomimicry Global Design challenge: Food Security. Past projects have involved sampling microbes in the air (ice nucleating bacteria) and experiments to understand the size vs density paradox in fern gametophytes (they are bigger when they are grown more densely).
      * Their program attempts to use the recommendations of [NSF/AAAS Vision and Change reports][2]
