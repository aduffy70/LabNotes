  * miRNA
      * Determine whether DNA sequences need to be reverse complemented - they don't. Some of them are reverse complements of each other but they are different entries for the same miRNA family so it appears this is intentional (i.e., either miRNAs are produced from both strands or we don't know which strand produces miRNAs.
      * Filter mature miRNAs for duplicates - filtered for exact matches and matches where the shorter sequence is entirely contained within a longer sequence (131 duplicates).
      * Identify seed sequences
      * Search for seed targets in GSTA4 UTR and coding sequence
