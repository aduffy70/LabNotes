  * Reading about eukaryote mRNA and particularly the 3' UTR (likely site of miRNA interaction sites):
      * Identifying the 3'UTR:
          * typically has a PAS (AAUAAA) toward the 3' end
          * CPE (UUUUUUAU) is usually within 100 bp of the PAS
          * often contains AU rich elements 50-150 bp long with multiple copies of AUUUA.
      * Longer 3' UTRs correspond to lower expression rates
      * 5' (imperfect) binding of miRNAs to the seed sequence leads to transcriptional repression
      * Perfect binding leads to transcript degradation
      * 5' UTR contains a Kozak consensus sequence (AGGAGGU) 3-10 bp upstream from the initiation codon (usually UAG).
      * Since all these 5's and 3's are relative to the mRNA sequence does that mean they are reversed in the DNA sequence?
  * Look into the [Argonaute CLIP method for identifying miRNA targets][1]
