  * microRNA reading
      * miRNAs are short (17-22bp) RNA fragments that guide RNA induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to a target mRNA strand. Bases at the 5' end (usually, but sometimes elsewhere, and not always exactly complementary) provide a match between miRNA and target.
      * ~487 miRNAs identified in turkey genome
      * If you have a known miRNA and you want to know it's targets you can biotinylate it so that after it binds to the target it can be bound to a substrate and pulled-down from the rest of the cell contents.
      * The kits Roger Coulombe sent a link to are to do that. But I think in our case we know the target and want to find the miRNA(s) that are acting on it - not the other way around.
      * Questions:
          * We can use antibodies to pull down GST mRNAs. If their expression is being blocked by miRNAs, when they are pulled down, the miRNAs should come with them, right?
          * Unless they are getting immediately cleaved, in which case the ones that get pulled down will be the ones that haven't yet bound to miRNA/RISC?
          * People have used miRNA seq to look at miRNA expression in cells. Could a comparison of miRNA expression in wild vs domestic turkey cells narrow down the Â list of potential miRNAs that might be involved? That assumes that the difference is in expression levels of miRNA. Isn't it also possible that the miRNA levels are the same, but some change in the miRNA or target sequence just makes them more likely to bind?
