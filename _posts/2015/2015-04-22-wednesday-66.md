  * Fluidigm gene expression report -stripped it to just the key points
  * GSTA miRNA targeting
      * run StarMir on GSTA1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 2
      * __There is more than one page for StarMir.__ You have to useÂ [ http://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/starmirtest2.pl ]( http://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/starmirtest2.pl ) (note the "test2") or it will only accept a single miRNA. If you try to enter more than one miRNA on the other form it tries to read them as one sequence so if their combined length is over 55bp you will get an error. Fought this for too long thinking there was something wrong with my fasta format!
