  * Gave update on search for miRNAs in RNA-seq data: ~60 miRNAs in the control domestic birds. Finding both mature and precursor sequences. Need to back up and rebuild the blast databases with info on the number of copies of each read so I can look at differences in expression level and miRNA sequence between domestic and wild
  * Roger recommended focusing on wild vs domestic rather than control vs treatment since we don't see large treatment effect
  * For the bigger picture of this project, be thinking about how we can use lab experiments to measure the activity of the miRNAs that I identify as potentially interesting.
