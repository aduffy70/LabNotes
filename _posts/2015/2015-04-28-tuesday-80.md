  * Set up meeting with Karen Mock to discuss what would actually be involved if I were to assist with her degraded DNA GBS/microsatellite project. She has offered to pay me to help and Roger Coulombe has left it up to me to decide whether I can do it without letting other projects suffer.
  * Declined a review request for manuscript #4760 from Biodiversity Data Journal. I'm no more qualified than anyone else with a glossary of botanical terms and undergraduate-level statistics. I checked with Paul Wolf to verify that it was not something he had recommended be sent to me. It came through Pensoft, so I'm likely just getting requests now that I'm in their system from PhytoKeys.
