  * Script to calculate depth of coverage from blast (format 4) output- forget it. It doesn't really give me anything useful. I'd hoped for an easy plot showing depth of coverage along the alignment, but because of the way I blasted at different stringencies and filled gaps I don't have one blast output that includes everything I need. It was an interesting exercise in how to parse blast output format 4 (which is definitely not simple).
