  * Paul Wolf is trying to do something similar to the script I wrote for finding primers conserved acrossed species (finder.pl). He has 15 genomes and wants primer pairs for about 80 loci. We tried my script on one of them and it doesn't do quite what he needs. It doesn't do any sort of filtering based on fragment length so that would have to be done after the fact. Also the locations of some of the primers show up as negative numbers. They are supposed to be nucleotide positions within the alignment so something must be wrong with the script.
