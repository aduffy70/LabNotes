  * Talking to Jake Weston about Lung Affymetrix data
      * He had the interesting idea to run comparisons of just the 3 controls and filter out all genes that are significantly differently expressed between them, then filter out those genes and only use the ones that are relatively similar as the control for the analysis with the Diesel and PM2.5 samples. It likely throws out a lot of useful info, but could give us something conservative to use as the control.
      * He ran analyses using all combinations of controls and Venn diagrammed the results. There is a small set of genes that are differentially expressed in ALL cases that we could use with some confidence that they are really up/down regulated... though the subset of those that have fold-changes over 1.5 is only around 25 genes.
      * He ran comparisons of what is differentially expressed between the controls and D12/P12 vs between D1/P1 and D12/P12 and those sets are only about 50% the same.
      * He is going to contact the Affymetrix rep to see if they have any advice for dealing with the huge variation between our control replicates or can offer any insight into what may have gone wrong to produce this result.
