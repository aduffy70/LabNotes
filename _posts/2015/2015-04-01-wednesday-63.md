  * Mtg with Paul Wolf and Carol Rowe. Shared the pipeline I used for the preliminary Crepidomanes GBS analysis. I think handling this as diploid data (even if the gametophytes really are diploid, which isn't certain) is not appropriate, since technically they are diploid gametophytes of tetraploid organisms. If they really are reproducing asexually we have 100% linkage between loci so analyzing using Structure is not appropriate. I need to look at how they analyze haploid organisms like bacteria or mosses.
  * Submitted abstract for Washington DC conference.
