  * Summarizing Crepidomanes GBS genotypes table.
      * Plots of Loci count vs Read count show that at my locus counts are starting to plateau at high read counts suggesting my samples with most highest read counts have most but not all loci
      * Only 3 loci are represented in all 43 samples. ~225 are in 80% of samples and ~2200 are in 70%
      * Pairwise comparisons of loci show that generally, pairs of samples with more loci share a higher proportion. I have 3 outlier samples that have very few loci based on their number of reads and these 3 also share many more loci with each other than expected by the number of loci. There may be some common sequences that were swept up early in PCR in all of these, but they could also be misidentified species. Dropping them from the preliminary analysis til I have time to investigate further.
