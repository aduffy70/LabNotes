  * Upgrade cordate to 12.04 (Update from 10.04 to 12.04 is automatic. Moving to 14.04 takes an additional update and since I haven't tested anything on 14.04 yet, best not to do it yet. This puts ALL my servers on 12.04 so I have 2 years before I have to worry about another upgrade.)
      * Updated the backup version on fernseed.usu.edu/VPCsim.html and verified that it is working (including plots and forms to update populations)
      * Followed [these instructions][1] to do the update over ssh (no screen session). Success!
