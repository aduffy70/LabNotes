    > # Predicting miRNAs potentially involved in domesticated turkey AFB<sub>1</sub>-susceptibility

    > Domesticated turkeys (_Meleagris gallopavo_) are highly sensitive to aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>), a hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, and immunosuppressive feed contaminant, whereas wild turkeys are better able to detoxify AFB<sub>1</sub>. The difference appears to be due to a dysfunction in the alpha class glutathione S-transferases (GSTA) of domesticated turkeys, and evidence suggests this dysfunction likely results from differences in gene regulation rather than protein structure. One possible mechanism of gene regulation is miRNA-mRNA interactions, but it is not known which of the 950 unique miRNAs identified in turkeys or predicted in the turkey genome are interacting with GSTA mRNAs. We used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from domesticated and wild turkey livers with and without exposure to AFB<sub>1</sub> to identify precursor miRNAs with the relative expression pattern expected for miRNAs involved in GSTA regulation. A subset of those miRNAs also have expression levels that differ between domesticated and wild turkeys or have predicted interactions (using Starmir) at sites with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between domesticated and wild turkey GSTA mRNAs, making them possible candidates to explain the difference in AFB<sub>1</sub>-susceptibility. Experimental validation of the interactions between each of these 13 candidate miRNAs and GSTA mRNAs is planned using anti-AGO RNA immunoprecipitation to determine whether any are responsible for the GSTA dysfunction in domesticated turkeys.
