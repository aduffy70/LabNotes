  * Wrote a script for Sean Moody to reformat his quail data to more easily paste into an existing excel spreadsheet. Showed him how to use basic terminal commands to get to the folder and run the script. Kept it simple- put a copy of the script in the folder with the files so he doesn't have to worry about paths, bash_profiles, etc.
      * cleantxt.py
