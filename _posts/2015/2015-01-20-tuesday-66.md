  * Short impromptu meeting with Roger Coulombe this morning:
    * We don't have the assemblies from the turkey RNA-Seq assemblies (from Monson et al. 2014) here, but I emailed Kent Reed (minnesota) to ask for access
    * Roger suggested looking into epistasis as another potential idea to explain AFB/GST differences in wild and domestic turkeys. Need to do some reading on epistatis.
    * Roger met with an Affymetrix rep about a new turkey SNP chip they have developed. It can handle up to 96 samples? He wants me to use this chip to go back over tissues we have already collected from wild and domestic turkey types. Need to do some reading on SNP chip analysis.
    * I need to go back and look at the literature for P450/AFB/GST pathways. I'm not clear on the role of Nrf/Keap in this process.
