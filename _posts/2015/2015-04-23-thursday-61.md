  * There is a problem with the sequencing data to verify that the Fluidigm expression is actually amplifying the exact gene we think. The GSTA3 sequence has 64 bases at the start that don't match anything in the BAC or Turkey chromosome 2, another hits in a GSTA for other organisms but not turkey, and one just returns bacterial matches. It looks like it is messy sequence. The trouble is, we could get messy sequence if we are actually amplifying 2 or more products together - which could happen easily in this family of very similar genes. Deepika Gaddam is going to redo the sequencing. We have to have clean sequence that matches the expected turkey sequences if we are to have confidence that our Fluidigm data has meaning.
  * GSTA miRNA targeting
      * rerun StarMir on GSTA3 and 4. The longnames in the miRNA fasta file result in the important parts getting cutoff in the StarMir output so I can't uniquely tie a hit back to one mature miRNA. The shortnames fasta file gives the desired result.
      * filter StarMir output for lists of unique sites and miRNAs
      * How to incorporate Kent Reed's SNP data for other varieties?
