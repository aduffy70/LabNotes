  * Affymetrix SNP chip analysis reading: Aslam et al. 2012 (BMC Genomics) identified turkey SNPs by sequencing 11 turkey varieties (domestic, heritage, and the southern Mexico wild type that the others were derived from). They also mention that SNPs have been identified within the reference genome assembly itself. I suspect this study is the source of the SNPs in the Affymetrix SNP chip. The data from this study is available in SRA and contains sequence for about 50% of the GSTA genes and surrounding regions.
