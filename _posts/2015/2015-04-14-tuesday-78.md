  * Get StarMir running to find miRNA targets in GSTAs
      * <a href="http://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/starmirtest2.pl" target="_blank">http://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/starmirtest2.pl</a>
      * Inputs:
          * fasta of mature mRNA sequences
          * Fasta with one mRNA sequence
          * start and end positions of the cds within the mRNA
      * Run it once using my "estimated mRNA" sequence
      * Run it using the Kim 2010 mRNA sequence
      * Other setting:
          * Model: VCLIP-based model (human)
          * Species for prediction: Other
          * MicroRNA sequences: Unique\_mature\_miRNAs.fasta
