GSTA miRNA targeting

  * Which primer pairs from Deepika Gaddam's inter-GSTA sanger sequencing cover the 5' and3' UTRs? (shared this with Deepika)
    * F6/R6 & F7/R7 - GSTA4 5'UTR (complete)
    * F8/R8 - GSTA4 3'UTR (partial. The primers don't give coverage of the first ~485 bases of the 3'UTR)
    * F19/R19 - GSTA3 5'UTR (partial. Primers only give coverage to 160276 and the cds doesn't start til 162716. We only have the first exon of the UTR.)
    * F20/R20 - GSTA3 3'UTR (complete)
    * F24/R24 - GSTA1.1 5'UTR (partial. Primers only give coverage to 175854 and the cds doesn't start til 176770. We only have the first exon of the UTR.)
  * Grabbed all sequences (and "redos" from Deepikas data for the primer sets listed above
  * Got the G4 with Sequencher from Carol Rowe to edit/assemble the sequences from these primer sets.
