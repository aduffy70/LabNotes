  * Crepidomanes GBS - why was I able to load the whole list of loci into memory when I was removing duplicates but I can't when I want to make a genotypes table?
  * Talked to Martin Schilling - He restarted the machine sunday because things seemed sluggish after we had both been running memory intensive processes. I will try the high-memory version of the find\_GT\_in\_all\_samplesNEW.pl script and see if it works any better now that we don't have bowtie runs on the workstation at the same time.
  * Moving all the files not currently being used to generate the Genotypes table into the external data drive because we are down to less than 100Gb free space on the home drive of the workstation again. These transfers take FOREVER. They are running at less than 5Mb/s!
