  * What is the half-life of a mature miRNA in the cell? What about the precursors?
  * Get back on the methylation project. Focus on just GSTA3 and GSTA4 and just Eastern Wild vs Nicholas. Since I now have a better idea of where the UTRs are this should bring the project down to a size where it can be done with a single sequencing run.
  * For Jake - What are the advantages/disadvantages of different methods for adjusting for multiple statistical tests? Which should he be using on the Lung PM2.5 data? Bonferroni seems to be too conservative - all differences become non-significant.
