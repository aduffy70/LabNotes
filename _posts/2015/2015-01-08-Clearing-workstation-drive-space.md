  * Karen Mock's Pine Beetle GBS runs on the workstation filled the harddrive. To clear space I removed all the intermediate files from my Crepidomanes analysis. We generate a lot of files but only really need to save the raw data and the last processed file, so I was able to remove 242 Gb of excess files. Also removed everything but the raw data and last processed file from the first Trichomanes GBS folders. Haven't done anything with Don's files but the same could work there. This freed 375Gb total so Karen should be able to complete her 5 runs if we keep deleting the unnecessary files after each new step.
    * Raw data 72Gb (keep)
    * correctedreads, ambiguousreads, distantreads 72Gb total
    * trimbarcodes 60Gb
    * cutadapt 55Gb
    * removeemptysequences 55Gb
    * fastq\_quality\_trimmer 54Gb (keep)
