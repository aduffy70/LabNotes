Get StarMir running to find miRNA targets in GSTAs
  * [Starmir Online Interface][1]
  * Inputs:
    * fasta of mature mRNA sequences
    * Fasta with one mRNA sequence
    * start and end positions of the cds within the mRNA
  * Run it once using my "estimated mRNA" sequence
  * Run it using the Kim 2010 mRNA sequence
  * Other settings:
    * Model: VCLIP-based model (human)
    * Species for prediction: Other
    * MicroRNA sequences: Unique\_mature\_miRNAs.fasta
