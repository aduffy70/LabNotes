  * Next step on Crepidomanes GBS
      * Check quality of post-endtrimmed data with fastq\_quality\_stats and compare to pre-endtrimmed results.
  * Continue miRNA background reading - what can we do with the available data? how can we get additional turkey/GST specific data?
      * Downloaded the fasta files of cdna and non-coding rna from Turkey Ensembl. Extracted the rna annotated as miRNA into a separate file (430 of them). Appear to be the sequence for the entire hairpin structure, not just the 22bp fragment.
