  * Crepidomanes GBS - I think I found a way to plot the proportions of most common sequences that shows a peak below 0.67 for Salvinia!
  * Lung Affymetrix data - Jake Weston has 3 new chips coming but they aren't from the same lot that all the "good" samples are on. It is a new lot # we haven't seen before. I think if we run all 3 control samples on the new ones, we should be able to see if they are comparable to the other lot, by comparing C2s. We will have a C2 run on the new lot and the C2 run on the same lot as all the "good" samples. Hopefully they are similar. If not, I think we have to rerun the entire experiment.
