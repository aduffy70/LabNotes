  * Next steps Crepidomanes GBS
      * Started 0.97 cluster at 4pm Monday. In the first 8 hours it got through 6 million reads. In the 2nd 8 hours it got through 19 million reads. The last 7 million reads tool less than an hour for a total of about 17 hours. Things speed up as the run progresses so predicting finish times from early results will not be effective. Also, it seems that the more reads that cluster the faster it goes, so things may speed up even more as I lower the identity of the clusters.
      * Started 0.96 cluster at 9am Tuesday.
      * Looking at different ways of plotting changes to highlight what is happening with larger clusters instead of everything being overshadowed by what is happening with singletons and tiny clusters.
  * Finish Turkey CBC/Weight data analysis
      * Performed pairwise comparisons of all the varieties - 2-way anova - and added the significant comparisons to the InteractionSummary spreadsheet.
      * I included comparisons of East-RG and Nich-BB because those within-Type comparisons demonstrate that even varieties of the same type have significantly different responses to the treatment for some measurements.
