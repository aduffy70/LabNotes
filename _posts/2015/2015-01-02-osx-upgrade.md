  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">Upgraded macbook pro (spore) to OSX Yosemite. Because I was using ReFit to dual boot Ubuntu and OSX the upgrade failed, so I backed up my files, made a bootable USB stick and tried to reformat the drive and do a clean install but the bootable USB stick was bad. I couldn't make a new USB stick because you have to have a mac running 10.6.8 or better to even download the Yosemite installer (and since I reformatted my drive I no longer had one) so I reinstalled 10.6.8 from disk, downloaded the installer and ran the update (which worked this time since my reformatted drive no longer had ReFit or Ubuntu on it). Reinstalled files and started reinstalling software.</span>
      * Couldn't reinstall Papers because I was running Papers 1, and only Papers 2 and 3 are available for download. I kept the folders with the actual pdf's but I have no way to access the database with citation info. Oh well, I was already in the process of converting over to PaperPile and 90% of what was in Papers I don't need anyway. Even most of the pdf's in the folders probably won't ever be needed since it is faster to find a paper through google. I'll keep them for those rare times when I can't find what I need online (though if it isn't online, how did I get a pdf into Papers?)
      * I'm not installing Sequencher again. I haven't assembled anything using it in years. If I need those files I can use the original sequence data and assemble using other tools. Worst case, if I absolutely need to open an old sequencher contig file I can borrow Paul Wolf's old macbook.
      * I'm not going to try to install an up-to-date python or R environment on this machine. I'll do my programming in linux. I can always ssh into one of my machines if I need to do something when I only have the laptop around.
      * Not reinstalling Google Drive or setting up mail or address books. I've converted to working in the cloud.
      * Not reinstalling Amazon cloud drive or Android transfer apps. I don't use them.
      * Still need to reinstall:
          * Google AppEngine Launcher
          * Unipro UGENE
          * Unity
          * Cisco VPN client
          * Imprudence (for VPGsim)
      * Still need to set up Time Machine. My backup drive contains the old time machine backup from before the upgrade and copies of the files from the laptop that have all now been transferred back to the laptop. I need to think about what/if I need to backup on this machine since the only files stored on it are things in Dropbox, my music and photos (which I keep on fiddlehead, where I DON'T have a backup plan), and my old Papers folders. In general I shouldn't have any critical files on the laptop that aren't synced with other machines. If I make a backup plan for fiddlehead I really don't need to worry about backing up spore. I like the idea of keeping this machine non-mission-critical (a convenience for mobile computing but quickly replaceable).
