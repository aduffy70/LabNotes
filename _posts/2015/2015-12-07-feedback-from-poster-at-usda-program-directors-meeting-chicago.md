  * Roger Coulombe presented the poster at the meeting Dec 3-4.
      * Our multi-faceted approach was well-received.
      * Look into gene regulation/silencing by viral sequences. Are there LTRs in the GSTA region?
  * I need to move into the lab and start confirming things.
  * Think about additional ways we can use the viable in vivo liver cells Sean Moody is developing.
