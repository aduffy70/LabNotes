  * Analyzing Sean Moody's quail prototype assay data:
      * 4 quail from each of 2 varieties (H1-H4, Q1-Q4), 1 mouse (M)
      * Three technical replicates of each individual run in June. Repeated the experiment in October twice, with three technical replicates each time
      * The experimental unit is the individual, so all these replicates should be averaged to provide a single measurement for each... BUT first I want to use them to look at where the variation in the experimental process is.
          * There are differences between the repeated experiments. If we use just June data, the H and Q varieties are clearly different. If we use just the October data there is not a significant difference between varieties. The results of the experiments are so different it doesn't seem to make sense to combine them. It feels like it would be like taking measurements in inches in one experiment, taking measurements in centimeters in the repeated experiment and averaging the inch and centimeter measurements.
          * We added more data (a second experiment for June, one for September, and a third for October and it just clouds the picture more. For June or September experiments there are clear differences between varieties, but for October there are not. It is like something happened after September and Q values stopped being higher than H values.
          * "Normalizing" the data by presenting the values as a percentage of the mouse values for that experiment doesn't change the fact that we get very different inferences in June and September than we do in October.
          * It does not seem to make sense. Sean wants to discuss in lab meeting to get ideas from Roger and the labgroup.

(Numbers before the months are not dates. TheyÂ were just to force them into sequential order instead of alphabetical order. Letters after the month indicate multiple experiments in the same month.)

**Update:** We discussed this in lab meeting and Sean is going to work with Deepika Gaddam to identify possible inconsistencies with his method. Once we are sure he can get consistent results we will try again.
