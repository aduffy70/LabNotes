GSTA miRNA targeting
  * rerun StarMir on GSTA3 and 4. The longnames in the miRNA fasta file result in the important parts getting cutoff in the StarMir output so I can't uniquely tie a hit back to one mature miRNA. The shortnames fasta file gives the desired result.
  * filter StarMir output for lists of unique sites and miRNAs
  * How to incorporate Kent Reed's SNP data for other varieties?
