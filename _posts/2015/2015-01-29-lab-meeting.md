  * Lab meeting
      * What is needed to wrap up the turkey CBC/weight data analysis?
          * I have the analyses showing which of the treatment x variety or treatment x type interactions are significant for everything but the time series weight data
          * I looked into time-series comparisons and they don't look promising. I can convert the data to one or more % weight increase measurements and do the same 2way anova as the other measurements
          * Roger Coulombe mentioned he was interested to know if it looked like a single variety could be used to represent each type. Based on the comparisons I have already, I don't think this will be possible, but I can do the formal tests to show that.
          * What else?
      * Update on miRNA and methylation
      * Find out more about turkey SNP chip. What is actually on it and how would we try to use it?
      * Work with Jake Weston on heatmaps (R?)
