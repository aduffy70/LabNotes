  * After talking to Paul Wolf and Martin Schilling about the method I am using to identify ploidy levels from GBS data, it looks like the info could be used to determine priors for bayesian analyses of ploidy and genotypes in samples where ploidy level may be variable. Karen Mock and Zach Gompert are also interested in seeing if this can work - Karen has aspen GBS data which may be from samples with different levels of ploidy. We need to confirm that my method actually works by testing it on a known diploid (working on Zach's Lycaeides now) and then we can also use it on all of Martin'sÂ Boechera samples since he also has flow cytometry data as a comparison.
