  * Take a look at Stacks for clustering GBS data (first within samples and then between samples to find variants). This is what Bernard Goffinet's lab is using for their haploid bryophyte RADseq work.
  * Can I do some BLAST searches of the 756 "haploid-like" Crepidomanes GBS loci to increase confidence that the random relationship between genetic and geographic distance is not because I have random data (i.e., lots of contamination from bacteria, fungi, etc.)?
