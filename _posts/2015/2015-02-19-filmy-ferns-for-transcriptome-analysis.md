  * Josh Der and Emily Sessa are looking for related gametophytes and sporophytes of a filmy fern for transcriptome analysis and asked for recommendations. I suggested the Hawaiian Vandenboschia davallioides (since I grew mats of gametophytes from a couple sporophytes and eventually got new juvenile sporophytes,), or Trichomanes boschianum (with the caveat that they'd need to verify the gametophytes weren't actually T. intricatum), or contacting Joel Nitta to see what he might have access to.
