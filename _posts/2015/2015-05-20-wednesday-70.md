  * Kent Reed is shipping the harddrive with RNA-seq data. Watch for it while Roger Coulombe is away.
  * Finished Conclusions section for DRK12 paper with Paul Wolf and forwarded all of our suggestions to the rest of the authors.
  * Take a look at Stacks for clustering GBS data (first within samples and then between samples to find variants). This is what Bernard Goffinet's lab is using for their haploid bryophyte RADseq work.
  * Can I do some BLAST searches of the 756 "haploid-like" Crepidomanes GBS loci to increase confidence that the random relationship between genetic and geographic distance is not because I have random data (i.e., lots of contamination from bacteria, fungi, etc.)?
