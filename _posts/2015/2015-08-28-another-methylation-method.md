  * Deepika Gaddam found a methylation sequencing method that compares melting temperatures of bisufilte-treated, and untreated DNA before sequencing so only fragments with different temperatures (those that have been modified by the bisulfite treatment) need to be sequenced, potentially reducing the amount of sequencing that needs to be done.
