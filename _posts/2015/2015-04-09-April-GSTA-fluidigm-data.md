  * Finish 2Way ANOVAs of the April GST Fluidigm data
      * It doesn't make much difference whether I use raw data or remove outliers - the patterns and significance levels are quite similar
      * It makes a BIG difference which housekeeping gene (GAPDH, BACTIN, or YWHAZ) is used for normalization - the patterns and the significance levels are different. GAPDH and BACTIN give more similar results than YWHAZ.
      * Deepika Gaddam make a second set of data that seems to be normalized differently (though I'm not sure how) but with the same housekeeping genes. I ran ANOVAs on those as well and put them in folders labeled G, A, and Y for now. Need to find out what these are and label them appropriately. It looks like the values are the same but the signs have changed on some, but not all.
