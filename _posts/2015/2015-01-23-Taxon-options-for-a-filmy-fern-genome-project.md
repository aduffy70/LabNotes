  * Paul Wolf has been talking to Emily Sessa and Sally Stevens about getting a chloroplast genome for a filmy fern since that is the only remaining fern group without one. I pointed them toward my partial Vandenboschia radicans genome in genbank (from Wolf et al. 2010 - Genome) and let them know I also have partial cp genomes from 454 data on Australian Vandenboschia johnstonense (from D. Rowe) and Japanese Crepidomanes thysanostum (from A. Ebihara). The Vandenboschia is only ~25% complete but the Crepidomanes is over 2/3 (I have maps for both in my old labbook showing what is covered - pg 135 & 166. I made these in 2010 using yasra/lastz to do scaffold assembly using all the then available fern cp genomes (Angiopteris, Adiantum, Alsophila, Cheilanthes, and Pteridium) as well as additional contigs identified from a Mira/Cap3 assembly. I told them there is likely still cpDNA in the data that could be identified using newer tools and methods and offered to share what I have done so far.Â We should also have extracted DNA still. This was all from the "Team CP" chloroplast enrichment project.
