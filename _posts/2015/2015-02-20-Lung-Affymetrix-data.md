  * Lung Affymetrix data- Roger Coulombe recommended contacting the Affymetrix rep to see if she suggests rerunning just the control chips or the entire analysis. Prepared an email with Jake Weston with images showing the bad MA plot for C1 and the variable Controls for Helene Galang at Affymetrix.
