  * Lab meeting
      * Nicholas seems to be an outlier variety in terms of gene expression levels and is not as commonly produced as BB White. It is unfortunate that the genomic tools were developed using Nich, since it may be atypical. Rerun Fluidigm 2way Anova with just EW and BB and generate a summary report for Kent Reed's group.
      * Are there examples in the literature of GSTA proteins that are inactivated by changes to the protein (NOT the mRNA or DNA sequence) such as acetylation or phosphorylation?
      * Are there genes around the GSTAs (and possibly in linkage disequilibrium) that are involved in the same pathways? Are there miRNAs encoded in this region? What is that 7SK RNA between GSTA4 and ICK?
  * Check out Monson thesis ch5-6 for info on gene expression in Nrf2 related genes.
  * Rerun Fluidigm 2way Anova w/just EW and BB.
  * Calculate standard deviationÂ for Fluidigm data for Deepika Gaddam (to show that the replicates from the same bird were similar)
