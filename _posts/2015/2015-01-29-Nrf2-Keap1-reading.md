  * Nrf2-Keap1 reading: Under normal cell conditions, Nrf2 is present but inactivated by binding to Keap1. Under oxidative or electrophilic stress, it separates from Keap1, moves to the nucleus and interacts with transcriptional regulation proteins to upregulate antioxidative proteins. Nrf2 is also involved in reducing or preventing inflammation.
