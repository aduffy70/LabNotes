  * To get geographic distances:
      * Made a table of latitude/longitude for each collection (field gps measurements dialed in with closer using Google Earth)
      * Wrote a python script to generate a table of all pairwise sets of locations (coordinatepairs.py) in the same order as the genetic distance table generated by R.
      * Used an online batch calculator to find the number of miles between each pair of coordinates - <a href="http://www.stevemorse.org/nearest/distancebatch.html" target="_blank">http://www.stevemorse.org/nearest/distancebatch.html</a>
      * Checked against Google Earth to make sure the distances calculated by the online tool match the distances calculated by Google Earth. They were within a mile even at sites 900 miles apart.
      * I handled zero distances 2 different ways:
          * If the two samples are extractions from the same collection I left the geographic distance at 0.
          * If the two samples are different collections from the same location I set the geographic distance to 0.1 miles or 0.2 km. Multiple collections from the same site were typically within this distance from each other and this distance is significantly smaller than the smallest distance between any two locations.
      * Converted the distances to kilometers in Excel and saved as csv
      * Read the csv list into R and converted it to an R distance object (by making a copy of the genetic distance object and replacing the genetic distances with the geographic distances. This was the simplest way to get all the other distance object metadata set correctly.
  * For all 2265 loci with 70% coverage and again for just the 756 loci with no heterozygosity:
      * Plotted genetic distance vs geographic distance
      * Did a mantel test of isolation by distance
      * There was no signal of isolation by distance for either set of data. If anything there is a weak negative correlation (genetic distance is lower at higher geographic distances - the opposite of isolation by distance).
  * In the plots of genetic distance vs geographic distance it appears there are clusters of genetic distance values. At all geographic distances there are large number of pairs with genetic distances clusterd around 7, 15, and 26. Looking at plots of just pairwise comparisons involving 1 sample at a time it is clear there are some samples that are genetically close to most other samples and some that are different from other samples. If I actually have more than one taxon in my samples I might expect a pattern like this, and it could hide a real pattern of IBD in the samples that are the same taxon. I calculated the average distance from each sample to all of the others and lined them up in increasing order. The first 26 samples values increase smoothly but there is a jump to the 27th at which point values increase rapidly. So, I separated out the 26 samples with the lowest average distance and made new geographic and genetic distance tables for just those. There is no pattern of IBD in this subset - the pattern for these 26 most genetically similar samples is similar to that of the larger datasets: a slight negative correlation between geographic and genetic distance.
  * Is there isolation by latitude? If I ignore the East-West distance and just use the North-South distance is there a meaningful pattern there?
      * Made  new geographic distance tables for the full set of samples and the low Dgen samples using only N-S distance (set all the longitude values to be equal)
      * The correlation between genetic distance and N-S distance is weakly positive, though the mantel tests don't reject the hypothesis of no correlation.

To summarize:

  * I find nothing to suggest isolation by distance in:
      * the full 2265 locus dataset,
      * the 756 locus homozygous dataset
      * the 756 locus dataset filtered for only the most genetically similar samples
      * the 756 locus dataset using only North-South distance
      * the 756 locus dataset filtered for only the most genetically similar samples and using only North-South distance
  * Showing results using the 756 locus homozygous dataset as an example:
