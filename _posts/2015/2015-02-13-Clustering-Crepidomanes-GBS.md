  * Clustering individual Crepidomanes GBS samples:
      * Clustered and plotted several C. intricatum samples but no clear 50%, 66%, or 75% peaks.
      * Clustered a T. boschianum and D. petersii and no clear peaks.
      * Either these are all haploid gametophytes or this method doesn't work. I need a positive control - something where I know the ploidy level. I think I can pull what I need from one of Zach Gompert's Lycaeides datasets since those should be diploid.
