  * Read Roux & Pannell 2015 paper from Paul Wolf on using approximate bayesian computation to infer the origin (auto or alloploidy) of polyploid species using high throughput sequencing data. I understand what they were trying to do and that it worked, but I don't understand the mechanics of what they actually did well enough to know if it could be done with the data I have. I think they assume that you KNOW you actually have a tetraploid and just want to know how the ploidy arose... whereas I don't know what the ploidy level of Crepidomanes is.
