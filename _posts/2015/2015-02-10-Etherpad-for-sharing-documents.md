  * Checked out etherpad - similar to google wave for collaborative sharing of links, text, code snippets, or documents. Could be really useful while teaching... all the benefits of a class/project page (like what I use for VPGsim) but more dynamic. Ethan White uses it for his software carpentry workshops. I set up a group etherpad at <a href="http://toxicology.etherpad.mozilla.org" target="_blank">toxicology.etherpad.mozilla.org</a> to try it out.
