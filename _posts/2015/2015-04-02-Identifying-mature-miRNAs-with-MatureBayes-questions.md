  * Used MatureBayes to identify the mature miRNA sequences in the 179 + 470 preliminary miRNA sequences from turkeys. Need to filter for duplicates. Also... For the sequences with T's rather than U's, are those just "DNAified" RNA sequences or are those the DNA sequences of the strand used to generate the RNA and thus, the reverse complement of the actual RNA? If there is any overlap between the 179 (RNA) and 470 (DNA) I should be able to tell.
