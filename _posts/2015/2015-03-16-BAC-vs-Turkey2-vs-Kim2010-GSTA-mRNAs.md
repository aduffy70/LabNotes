  * Extract sequences from Turkey Liver Transcriptome
      * GSTAs
      * Nrf2
      * Nrf2 target genes:Â HMOX1 (heme oxygenase), NQO1 (NADPH quinine oxidoreductase), GCL (glutamate-cysteine ligase- has two separate subunits, GCLC and GCLM)
      * Bioactivation genes: CYP1A5 and CYP3A37
  * Annotated GSTAs in BAC37H15 vs Turkey2.01:
      * GSTA4 in both are identical
      * GSTA3 differ by 10 mismatches around bp 80-90 (end of exon1, exon2, and start of exon3)
      * GSTA3_alt and GSTA3 differ by 10 mismatches plus a 3bp insert in the same area
      * GSTA1_201 in Tu2.01 is identical to GSTA1.1 in BAC
      * GSTA1_203 differs from GSTA2 in BAC by 10 mismatches around bp 80-90 (start of exon2)
      * GSTA1_202 also best matches GSTA2 in BAC, but only after exon1 and up til the last 6bp
      * Nothing in Tu2.01 closely matches GSTA1.2 or GSTA1.3 in the BAC
  * The annotations in the BAC are based on transcripts sequenced in the same project (Kim et al, 2010). BAC vs Kim2010:
      * GSTA1.1, 1.2, 1.3 - BAC and Kim2010 sequences are identical
      * GSTA2 - 1 SNP
      * GSTA3 - 2 SNPs
      * GSTA4 - 2 SNPs (different individuals were used- both Nicholas variety - so the SNPs aren't surprising)
  * I think the Kim2010 sequences and BAC sequences are to be trusted more than the Turkey_2.01 sequences because:
      * The BAC sequence is more trustworthy than the 2.01 assembly
      * The Kim2010 sequences represent actual sequences of cDNA from Nicholas turkey mRNA whereas the Turkey_2.01 sequences are just sections of the questionable assembly that have had transcript sequences from several taxa aligned with them to find homologous regions.
