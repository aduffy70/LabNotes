  * Updated to the latest version of LibreOffice using their PPA (instead of Ubuntu's). This gave me the latest "Fresh" release, 4.4. It does a better job of displaying charts created in recent Excel versions but still has issues. Need to do the same at home and see if it is a 32 vs 64 bit problem.
  * Added a .Rprofile file to my home folder. Any R functions placed in this file are available whenever R runs. Added one to allow setting the width of data displayed to be wider.
  * Sent captions for Hymenophyllum wrightii photos to Teresa Haugh for the Forest Service press release.
  * Hand-me-down computer from Roger Coulombe:
      * spore-2
      * macbookpro 2012 A1278 Serial No C1MHVWU6DTY3
      * Installed necessary software and registered on bluezone
