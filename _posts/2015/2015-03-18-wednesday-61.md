  * Mtg with Paul Wolf @ 1:30
    * If I can get background slides and even the most basic preliminary analysis for Friday he can use it in his presentation - even just the number of loci would be something
    * Wait til April to get with Martin on the ploidy analysis project. He has known diploids, triploids, and tetratploids we can compare.
    * Confirmed he will be around for commencement/hooding
    * Abstracts for DC conference are due April 1.
  * npGeno pipeline problems with Crepidomanes GBS data - solved it! (Ns in the pseudogenome causing problems)
