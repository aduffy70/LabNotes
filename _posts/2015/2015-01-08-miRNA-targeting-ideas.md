  * Looking into bioinformatic ways of identifying potential miRNAs affecting GSTs.
    * TargetScan.org let's you pick a human, mouse, chicken gene and see what known human, mouse, worm, etc miRNAs have binding sites and how those sites are conserved acrossed taxa. Potentially useful, but didn't have many hits to GSTA3.
    * There are miRNAs annotated in the turkey genome (487?). We could search each of those for partial homology to the GSTA UTRs from turkey. Perhaps do the same thing for chicken since there is more data on miRNAs in chicken and then look for homology to turkey?
