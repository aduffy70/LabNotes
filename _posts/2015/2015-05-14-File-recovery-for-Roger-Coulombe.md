  * Exploring Roger's recovered files from his old harddrive. I wrote scripts to pull text from word, powerpoint and other files so he can scan through looking for potentially useful files to save.
  * Copied Roger Coulombe's recovered files from the Window's formatted backup drive to a HFS+ formatted drive he can use on his mac. Ubuntu won't write to HFS+ in the default journaled format so I turned off journaling on the drive. For some reason (naming convention issues from windows? sheer volume?) the copy wouldn't work through nautilus but I was able to do it at the command line.
