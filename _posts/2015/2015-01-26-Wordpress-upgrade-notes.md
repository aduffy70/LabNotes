  * WordPress upgrades - Upgraded cyberlearning.usu.edu and elab.aduffy70.org sites to latest wordpress 4.1
    * Not thrilled about the changes to the WYSIWYG editor. Font feels huge and window expands as I type. Ugh. I'll try it for a few days and look for solutions if it still bugs me (I tried the visual-editor-font-size plugin but it is awkward - there are ways to permanently change this by customizing the theme.
    * Had to redo the mod to functions.php I described on Dec. 19, 2014 to keep the favicon on admin pages.
    * Had to create a new empty menu, because the top navigation bar now INSISTS on having a menu assigned to it so it was always showing my Data Links menu, even if I told it not to.
