  * Lab meeting @ 10
    * Prepared data to show the result of my attempt to find miRNAs targeting GSTAs, and particularly GSTA4. It looks like the method won't filter enough - out of 875 total miRNAs 800 potentially target the handful of SNPs in GSTA4 3'UTR. The problem is the seedless matches. The seed matches filter down nicely but there are just too many seedless matches. Many of them are low probability matches, but I don't have any objective way to filter by quality.
    * Kent Reed is sending a harddrive with RNA-Seq data from ALL of the turkey varieties. Can I search this to see which miRNAs are present and combine that with my data on predicted targets?
