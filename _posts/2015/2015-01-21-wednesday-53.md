  * Read Roux & Pannell 2015 paper from Paul Wolf on using approximate bayesian computation to infer the origin (auto or alloploidy) of polyploid species using high throughput sequencing data. I understand what they were trying to do and that it worked, but I don't understand the mechanics of what they actually did well enough to know if it could be done with the data I have. I think they assume that you KNOW you actually have a tetraploid and just want to know how the ploidy arose... whereas I don't know what the ploidy level of Crepidomanes is.
  * Affymetrix SNP chip analysis reading: Aslam et al. 2012 (BMC Genomics) identified turkey SNPs by sequencing 11 turkey varieties (domestic, heritage, and the southern Mexico wild type that the others were derived from). They also mention that SNPs have been identified within the reference genome assembly itself. I suspect this study is the source of the SNPs in the Affymetrix SNP chip. The data from this study is available in SRA and contains sequence for about 50% of the GSTA genes and surrounding regions.
