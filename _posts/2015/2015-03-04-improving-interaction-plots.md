  * I remade the interaction plots for Nrf2 and GSTA3 with the y axis flipped so more mRNA is up and with the Control to the left so it is more intuitive to look at. I did those 2 specifically because the Nrf2 is the one with significant interaction effects, and GSTA3 is the cleanest example of one without interaction effects. Most of the other genes show a similar pattern or one that isn't significantly different from that pattern, that is, both wild and domestic have higher mRNA when exposed to AFB, and overall the Wild birds have higher mRNA.  Having just those 2 simplifies what we are looking at as we talk about this.
