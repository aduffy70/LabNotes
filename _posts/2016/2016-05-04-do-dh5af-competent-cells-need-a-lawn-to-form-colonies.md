From the product documentation it appears that Invitrogen DH5aF'IQ competent cells can't form plaques (=colonies?) for blue/white screening without a lawn of F+ cells, but the documentation isn't clear and I'm frustrated trying to find online info to explain why. So I am running an experiment to:

  1. See whether transformed competent cells can form colonies without lawn cells, and
  2. Make sure that my +Amp plates actually prevent growth of untransformed cells.
  3. Confirm that the competent cells are still viable.

Three plates:

  1. Transformed with 1uL m13mp19RF plasmid and plated with lawn cells.
  2. Transformed with 1uL m13mp19RF plasmid and plated without lawn cells.
  3. Not transformed (went through the same heat cycles but no plasmid added) and plated with lawn cells.

Predictions:

  * If lawn cells are needed I should have colonies on #1 but not #2.
  * If lawn cells are not needed I should have colonies on #1 and #2.
  * If I have colonies on #3 my +Amp isn't working.
  * If there is no growth on #1 my competent cells are not competent, not viable, or (less likely) the control plasmid is bad.

Results:

  * No colonies on any of the plates after 24 hours at 37C.
  * The competent cells aren't viable, they aren't competent anymore, or the control plasmid is bad.
  * I could trouble shoot this for days or just get new competent cells - preferably ones that I am certain don't need lawn cells. I also don't know if the cloning vector and ligation mix we have on hand are good and I can't test those without competent cells. Rather than buying cells, waiting for them to arrive, and then possible discovering the vector and ligation mix are bad too, I'm just going to buy the Qiagen kit that includes all of it (231222 Qiagen PCR Cloning Plus Kit (10 reactions)- $264). I may need more than 10 reactions but I'll buy them as needed rather than risk overstocking (like we clearly did in the past). Also, if I modify the protocol to match the quantities from Jim Smith's I'll use half the amount of competent cells per reaction and get 20 reaction instead of 10.
