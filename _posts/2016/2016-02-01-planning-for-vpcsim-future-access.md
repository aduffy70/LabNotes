The Unity3D plugin that runs VPCsim is not supported by recent versions of Google Chrome, is not supported by Edge, and FIrefox will be dropping support in March 2016.

  * Most users are still using old version of Chrome, Firefox, or Explorer (meaning they aren't using the built-in plots) so the loss of support in current browsers may not be an immediate problem.
  * The long-term fix is to update VPCsim to use Unity3D's new html5-based system.
  * I discussed it with Max Longhurst and Todd Campbell and they may be able to pay me for the time it takes to make the changes. I need to look into it and provide them with a time estimate. I don't think I can provide a realistic estimate since I won't know what issues will arise until I try to do the update.  It may make more sense to do it on my own time, then tell them how long it "will take" and get paid for the time after the fact.
