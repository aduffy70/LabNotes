Todd wants to try to incorporate VPCsim in a different type of learning activity from what we have done with it before.

He needs a story of some specific phenomena that the students can research further that can also be demonstated (at least in part) in VPCsim.

It is about model building or explaining natural phenomena rather than inquiry.

# Things it can be used to investigate:
 * interactions of plants with their environment. One plant may do better in one set of conditions than another set. Another plant may require a different set.
 * effects of human disturbance (different frequencies, different sizes). Different plants will respond to disturbance differently.
 * habitat fragmentation. What happens to a plant community or specific plant species when the habitat is made of small patches rather than one continuous area?
 * competition between species
 * effects of invasive species
 * climate change (more than just hotter/cooler, but also wetter/dryer and combinations)
 * "reforesting" or post-fire regrowth (with or without reseeding)
 * Interactions of all of these with each other

Could lead to a practitioners' article. It would be nice to point people back to VPCsim as a tool they can use for another type of activity.
