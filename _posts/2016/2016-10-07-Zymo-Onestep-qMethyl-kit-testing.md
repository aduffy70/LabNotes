# Notes

* 20ng DNA in each reaction. Protocol specifies 5uL of 4ng/uL solution. We need to make dilutions.
* They provide enough reagents to run 8 sets of control reactions (The human methylated and non-methylated DNA standard is the limiting factor (40uL of each @ 5uL per)).
* QMETH001: We set up reactions to test:
  * Can we amplify the top section, bottom section, and complete promoter?
  * Does it work better with or without GC enhancer?
  * Does it work on both Wild and Domestic turkey DNA?
* QMETH001 results:
