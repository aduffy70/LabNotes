[Atom editor]( http://atom.io ) is becoming integral to my workflow. Time to document some settings. Updated Feb 2022:

# Community packages installed

  * filetree-autohide(sanarena)
  * ~~language-fasta (mine, on Github)~~ I don't use this anymore. It was slow and clunky
  * ~~language-r (lee-dohm)~~ I use RStudio for R files now
  * ~~markdown-writer (zhuochun)~~ I don't use this anymore


# Community themes installed

  * None. I use the core UI theme Atom Light and the core syntax theme One Light.
  * ~~monokai (kevinsawicki)~~
  * ~~github-atom-light-syntax (primer)~~  

# Init files:

My updated init.coffee and config.cson are in Dropbox/Notes. I got tired of updating this post when I made a change.

# Other settings:

I use font family Ubuntu Mono with font size 18 on the laptop and 16 on the desktop. Most are settings are the defaults now.
