[Atom editor]( http://atom.io ) is becoming integral to my workflow. Time to document some settings:

# Community packages installed

  * language-fasta (mine, on Github)
  * language-r (lee-dohm)
  * markdown-writer (zhuochun)


# Community themes installed

  * monokai (kevinsawicki)
  * github-atom-light-syntax (primer)  


# Init files:

My updated init.coffee and config.cson are in Dropbox/Notes. I got tired of updating this post when I made a change.
