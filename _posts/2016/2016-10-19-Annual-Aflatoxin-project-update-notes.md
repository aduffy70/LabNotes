# Notes

  * Replace mRNAseq-based miRNA analysis with miRNAseq-based results
  * New methylation info
    * presence/absence of CpG islands
    * preliminary qMethyl results
    * bisulfite sequencing plan for GSTA4/GSTA3.
  * Splicing variant status... what can we say from the results so far?
  * Update sequence variant section with latest from Kent Reed on SNPs in 3'UTR.
  * Any update on the GSTA3/4 antibodies? Data we can show?
    * Nothing on specificity tests or conjugation tests
    * Deepika's preliminary western blots showing differences in protein expression

First draft comments from Roger:

  * Take a conversational tone to describe the challenges we have faced so far and that are driving our current strategy:
    * The turkey genome is a powerful tool but incomplete. The region on Chromosome 2 where the GSTA genes are located has sections of missing sequence we've had to fill, and there are drastic differences between different assembly versions that affect gene order and presumed promoter regions. We have relied on a BAC sequence that covers this region but we things fail we have repeatedly had to question whether it is because the sequence is not what we think it is.
  * To answer my questions about the antibody data:
    * The data we have suggests that the antibodies do bind to the GSTA proteins but we haven't been able to demonstrate that they block the enzyme activity. We don't have data showing they don't block the enzyme--it is demonstrated by our lack of data, but it was attempted by both Fran and Deepika.
    * We need to get new antibodies.
  * Make a version with no figures or tables- the online submission system only takes text.
