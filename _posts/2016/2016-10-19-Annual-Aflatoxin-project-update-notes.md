# Notes

  * Replace mRNAseq-based miRNA analysis with miRNAseq-based results
  * New methylation info
    * presence/absence of CpG islands
    * preliminary qMethyl results
    * bisulfite sequencing plan for GSTA4/GSTA3.
    * include NRF2 plans? (justified by the fluidigm data showing NRF2 with significant expression differences between types)
  * Splicing variant status... what can we say from the results so far?
  * Any update on the GSTA3/4 antibodies? Data we can show?
