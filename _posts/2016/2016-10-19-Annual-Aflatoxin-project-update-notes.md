# Notes

  * Replace mRNAseq-based miRNA analysis with miRNAseq-based results
  * New methylation info
    * presence/absence of CpG islands
    * preliminary qMethyl results
    * bisulfite sequencing plan for GSTA4/GSTA3.
  * Splicing variant status... what can we say from the results so far?
  * Update sequence variant section with latest from Kent Reed on SNPs in 3'UTR.
  * Any update on the GSTA3/4 antibodies? Data we can show?
    * Nothing on specificity tests or conjugation tests
    * Deepika's preliminary western blots showing differences in protein expression
