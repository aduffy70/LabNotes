All the gels I've run in the Coulombe lab have wavy, smeared ladder bands- particularly the longer bands. I don't see this on gels I've run in the Wolf Lab.

  * I've been running gels for 20-30 minutes at 120V (8V/cm). Tried for 25 and then 50 minutes at 70V (5V/cm) with no improvement
  * I've been loading 2uL of ladder. Tried 1uL, 2uL, and 3uL with no improvement.
  * I've been using 0.5XTBE gels and buffer. Tried 1XTBE gels and buffer. This looks better but the longer bands are still wavier than I am used to seeing.
  * Try Coulombe lab reagents on Wolf lab equipment and vice versa. Coulombe reagents on Wolf equipment looks slightly better, but not much.
  * After doing some reading I suspect that I need to be sure the gel is completely melted before pouring and let the gels solidify a bit longer before loading. My results aren't consistent acrossed the gel and things look worse toward the edge. I tend to run gels in the Coulombe lab in the afternoon when I am under a time crunch so I load as soon as it seems solid enough to remove the comb. Gels I run in the Wolf lab in the morning sit longer before pouring because I get distracted by other tasks as I wait. Also I've always used exactly 1 minute microwave time to melt gels in the Wolf lab but the Coulombe lab has a microwave with an imprecise knob and probably has lower power level as well (it is smaller).
  * I also made new 5X TBE stock, made 1X TBE from that, and got rid of all the 0.5X TBE. No more 0.5X TBE gels!
  * We'll see how fresh reagents, 1X TBE, longer melt times, and longer solidifying times improve things.
  * Tried borax and TAE gels.
      * Borax looked just like TBE (though it ran faster)
      * TAE had bettter separation of long bands
  * The gel rig bath box started flaking out (no current flow) and when I switched to the other one (that I'd avoided since it has no leveling feet) my TBE gels started looking normal. By wiggling the lid on the "good" box I can make the current fluctuate and even cut out. By wiggling the lid on the "bad" box I can find one sweet spot where it works and everywhere else it cuts out. The insides of the banana connectors on the lid are black with corrosion. I took them apart, filled them with concentrated HCl, let it sit for 5 minutes and flushed thoroughly with water and then EtOH. They look like metal again, and when I put them on either box, they work and I can wiggle without the current fluctuating. Â I did it to the cracked backup lid as well. Both seem stable on either box now.
