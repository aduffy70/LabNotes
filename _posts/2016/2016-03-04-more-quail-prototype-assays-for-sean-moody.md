  * More data to analyze. This time, DCNB and CHP.
  * Same as last batch, verify that there aren't significant differences between experiments and then test for differences between Quail types.
  * There is some potential weirdness in the DCNB data (negative values and it doesn't look consistent between replicates and experiments). Sean thinks it may be that the values are at the lower limits of the instrument's range. Run the analysis on it anyway and see what we get.
  * Results:
      * For DCNB the two experiments ARE significantly different. They are not different for CHP.
      * For DCNB, the two Quail types are significantly different (though the experiments being different makes it questionable whether we should use this data). For CHP there is no statistical difference between the two Quail types.
