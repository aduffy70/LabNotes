While designing primers for Zymo OneShot methylation I noticed some strange things about the GSTA4 promoter region. Specifically I am looking at the 1585bp directly upstream of the GSTA4 start codon ().

  * The Turkey5.0 assembly differs from the BAC sequence in this region
    * The first 1009bp are 32000bp downstream of the last 474bp. The bases from 1010 to 1111 don't have any close hits in Turkey5.0.
  * The way this is split fits our PCR results in some ways:
    * primers 1-f to 1-r should amplify
    * primer 2-f to 2-r and 1-f to 2-r should fail because the primers are far apart on the chromosome
