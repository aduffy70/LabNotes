[ Zymore Research One step qMethyl kit ]( http://www.zymoresearch.com/epigenetics/dna-methylation/region-specific-dna-methylation-analysis/onestep-qmethyl-kit )

  * Uses methylation sensitive restriction enzymes and real time PCR to estimate relative levels of methylation in specific regions of multiple samples.
  * Half of each sample is digested, the other (control) is not. If the restriction sites in the region are methylated, no cutting will occur and the CT of the digested and control reactions will be the same. If they are not methylated, the digested sample will be fragmented and will not amplify and the difference in CT can be used to estimate the level of methylation in the tissue.
  * The reaction focuses on any 120-350bp fragment that you can design primers for, and restriction sites in the primer are not a problem- they actually make the process work better.
  * It uses 3 different restriction enzymes so you are looking at CpG sites in three different contexts: CGCG, CCGG, and ACGT
  * Uses SYTO9 dye in the PCR which is compatible with settings for Sybr Green. There is also a -lite kit without the dye if we need to use something different.
  * $342 for a 96 well plate which can handle up to 22 samples in duplicate plus the necessary positive/negative controls. So 5 birds X 4 treatments would fit in one plate.
  * From [ Zymore's protocol ]( http://www.zymoresearch.com/downloads/dl/file/id/79/d5310i.pdf ):
