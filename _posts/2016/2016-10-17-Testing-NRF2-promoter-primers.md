# Goal- amplify and sequence the missing section of DNA upstream of the NRF2 mRNA

  * PCR0237:
    * Trying to amplify the ~1200bp section of unknown DNA immediately upstream of the NRF2 mRNA (the likely promoter region) using all 4 combinations of the NRF2_promoter forward and reverse primers.
    * Testing on a Domestic (N1) and Wild (EW1) sample.
    * Expected lengths (assuming the NNNNs in the Turkey5.0 assembly accurately represent the size of the missing section):

| primer pair | length (bp) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| NRF2_promoter1-F to 1-R | 1333 |
| NRF2_promoter1-F to 2-R | 1279 |
| NRF2_promoter2-F to 1-R | 1327 |
| NRF2_promoter2-F to 2-R | 1273 |

* PCR0237 results:
