Discussion with Paul Wolf:

I'm having trouble amplifying most markers from the filmy fern samples I used in my GBS run. I have a marker (atpB-rbcL spacer) I think I can use to sort them by species, but it would be good to also be able to amplify some sequence from each of my species, compare it to Genbank sequence, and confirm that the species are all what we think they are.

rbcL would be best, but it is not working on the Didymoglossom or "mystery fourth species".

Can I use the sequences that are available to design primers that will amplify a small (less likely to be degraded) section of rbcL, which still has sufficient variability to see where these fall in the filmy phylogeny?
