Discussion with Paul Wolf:

I'm having trouble amplifying most markers from the filmy fern samples I used in my GBS run. I have a marker (atpB-rbcL spacer) I think I can use to sort them by species, but it would be good to also be able to amplify some sequence from each of my species, compare it to Genbank sequence, and confirm that the species are all what we think they are.

rbcL would be best, but it is not working on the Didymoglossom or "mystery fourth species".

Can I use the sequences that are available to design primers that will amplify a small (less likely to be degraded) section of rbcL, which still has sufficient variability to see where these fall in the filmy phylogeny?

  * There are not Didymoglossom petersii (or Trichomanes petersii) or Vandenboschia boschiana (or Trichomanes boschianum) rbcL sequences in genbank
    * D. petersii is in Didymoglossom subgenus Didymoglossom. Other examples of this subgenus (according to [Ebihara et al 2006][1]) that DO have rbcL sequences in genbank:
      * D. tahitense
      * D. motleyi
      * D. krausii
      * D. barklyanum (barklianum)
      * D. lorencei
      * D. hildebrandtii
      * T. reptans
      * T. punctatum
      * T. liberiense
      * T. hymenoides
      * T. pinnatinervium
      * T. membranaceum
      * T. gourlianum
    * V. boschiana is in Vandenboschia subgenus Vandenboschia. Others w/rbcL in genbank:
      * V. radicans
      * V. maxima
      * V. birmanica
      * V. davalliodes
      * V. liukiuensis
      * V. collariata
      * V. speciosa (very different from others)
      * V. cyrtotheca
      * V. gigantea
      * T. maximum
      * C. birmanicum
      * T. johnstonense
      * T. radicans
    * C. intricatum is in Crepidomanes subgenus Crepidomanes section Crepidomanes. Others w/rbcL in genbank:
      * C. schmidianum (schmidtianum)
      * C. makinoi
      * C. latealatum
      * C. kurzii
      * C. bipunctatum
      * C. acuto-obtusum
      * C. mettenii
      * C. africanum
      * C. melanotrichum
      * C. inopinatum (inopinata)
      * C. fallax
      * C. intramarginale
      * C. frappieri
      * C. clarenceanum
      * C. chevalieri
      * C. melanotrichum
      * C. christii
      * C. vitiense
      * C. latealatum
      * C. latemarginale
      * T. walleri


How do the rbcL primers align to each of these two groups?
