Updating fiddlehead to Ubuntu 16.04 and setting it up to replace crozier as my main work machine. With 6 cores and 16Gb RAM it is my best machine and is underused at home.

  * Moved personal files to spore and verified updated my music library and photo library on spore
  * Installed 16.04 from usb drive with default partitioning
