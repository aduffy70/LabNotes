Sean Moody ran 3 assays on the same mouse and quail samples to try to determine whether the process he is using gives consistent results. The first assay had issues that he expected based on a problem setting up the assay, but the other two were consistent. There were significant differences between the samples as expected but no significant differences between the 2 assays.
