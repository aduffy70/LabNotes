"Regulation glutathione S-transferases and hematology differences in response to AFB-exposure in wild and domesticated turkeys"

We can show what we know about the mRNA expression levels of GSTAs and other AFB/P450 response-related genes from both fluidigm and RNAseq, and discuss how it relates to our hypotheses about differences in AFB-susceptibility between wild and domestic birds.

We can also present the CBC and weight gain data showing differences in hematology, liver mass, and growth rate. - __I can show the statistical comparisons, but I'll need help discussing what the various measurements mean biologically and determining whether statistically significant differences are biologically significant.__

Data to include:

  * Wild (EW) vs Domestic (BB). __We have data for others... leave it out to keep the story trim and clear?__
  * Fluidigm mRNA expression data (April data, GAPDH normalized, EW vs BB)
      * GSTA1.1, GSTA1.2, GSTA1.3, GSTA2, GSTA3, GSTA4
      * Nrf2
      * Cyp3a37
      * hmox1
      * nqo1
      * Cyp1a5 (RT-qPCR, not fluidigm)
  * Include mRNAseq expression data? Or just refer back to it if it is being published separately? __- At a minimum we should check the genes we checked using fluidigm.__
  * GSTA protein levels from antibody blots __- We have one, can we expand sampling, quantify the band brightness, and run stats?__
  * Assays of protein activity __- Data contradict our hypotheses? What are these assays really measuring? Confounding activity of other GSTAs and possibly other unknown genes? This assay many not be relevant, the AFB trapping assay and Immunoinhibition experiments Deepika is working on better reflect GSTA activity relevant to AFB.__
  * CBC data

| DNA sequence | mRNA level | Protein level | Protein Activity |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
|Recombinant expression shows minor GSTA sequence differences don't matter | Fluidigm data for GSTAs, P450 activators, and Nrf2. RNAseq data? | Western blots with GSTA3/4 antibodies. | Prototype assays. AFB trapping assay. Immunoinhibition experiment. CBC data? |
