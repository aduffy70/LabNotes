Just looking at CDNB and ECA.

2 experiments of each with 2 replicates of each experiment.

He ran 2 varieties of quail with a mouse control.

  1. Check that there aren't significant differences between experiments using repeated measures ANOVA. - There are no significant differences between experiments in either assay.
  2. Combine the experiments/replicates into a single average value for each sample and look for differences between varieties using 1-way ANOVA (drop mouse since we know it will be different and we don't care). We want to know if the 2 varieties of quail are different. - They are different for DCNB but not for ECA.

Sent Sean the results and ANOVA output files.
