I re-extracted DNA from suspected D. petersii gametophytes, S26 mystery gametophyte and my one D. petersii sporophyte sample.

The sporophyte re-extraction has reasonable concentration (41ng/uL). One D.pet gametophyte extraction failed, but the other has at least some DNA (6ng/uL). The S26 mystery gametophyte has very low DNA (2ng/uL). See if we can get anything to amplify from these three.

* PCR0221
  * D.pet gametophyte, S26 mystery gametophyte and D.pet sporophyte on rps4-trnS, F1F-F1379R (rbcL), and atpB-rbcL.
* PCR0221 results:
  * rps4-trnS: everything failed but positive control
  * F1F-F1379R: No expected bands. On all but S26 there are bright very short bands (<100bp) - longer than the primer dimers but definitely not the expected length for rbcL. **F26 instead of F1F may work better... retry?**
  * atpB-rbcL: Visualized in the Coulombe Lab so I can crank the exposure way up. Expected bands on D.pet gametophyte, D.pet sporophyte, and positive control. The D.pet sporo seems to have the shorter length fragment (like V.bosch) but the D.pet gamet has the longer fragment (like C. int)? There is also a brighter unexpected 150bp band on the D.pet sporo?
