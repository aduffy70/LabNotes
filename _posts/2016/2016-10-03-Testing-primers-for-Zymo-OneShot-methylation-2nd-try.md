We designed a second set of primers to amplify the GSTA4 promoter in two pieces for the Zymo OneShot methylation kit. We made longer primers, with higher Tms to avoid the non-specific binding we were getting and moved out further on either side of the CpG island to avoid the sequence that is similar to sequence on chromosome 1.

Trying all combinations of the new forward primers with the old and new reverse primers. Some of these should make very small, not-useful fragments, but since there is some disagreement between the BAC and turkey 5.0 sequences in this region, I want to see which combinations work.

    * Running at 54C annealing temperature, just below the new primer with the lowest Tm (by IDT's calculations--Primer3 says they are all ~4C higher.)
    * 3-F to 1-R: expected length ~490bp
    * 3-F to 2-R: expected length ~910bp
    * 3-F to 3-R: expected length ~450bp
    * 3-F to 4-R: expected length ~925bp
    * 4-F to 1-R: expected length ~120bp
    * 4-F to 2-R: expected length ~525bp
    * 4-F to 3-R: expected length ~80bp
    * 4-F to 4-R: expected length ~540bp
