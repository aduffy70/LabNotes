#Problem:

  * The 5X and 1X TBE we use for gels keeps precipitating, even after heating/stirring and sonicating.
  * Gels poured using this TBE have bright blotches that make dim bands hard to see.

# Solution:

  * Forum discussions suggest that autoclaving TBE stocks will reduce crystallization but if there is dust or any particles that crystals can start to form around they will come back.
  * I thoroughly scrubbed all glasswear used to use or store TBE or run gels and got a brand new jar to hold 5X stock.
  * I discarded all old TBE stock and made new 5X stock, autoclaved it, and made a 1X dilution.
  * The TBE stock has stayed clear for 2 weeks and gels don't have those white cloudy blotches.
