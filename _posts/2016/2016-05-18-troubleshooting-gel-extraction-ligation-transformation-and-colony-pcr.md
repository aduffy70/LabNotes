My initial attempts at cloning pcr products for 5' RACE failed. Here is what I'm doing to troubleshoot the process:

  * Gel extraction
  * Ligation
      * This process is suspect-I get blue colonies and light blue colonies, but no white colonies.
      * It is possible the light blue colonies have the insert but it is not completely LacZ expression (which is reported to happen with small inserts like mine)
          * Tried colony PCR on light blue and dark blue colonies
      * Trying to optimize the amount of PCR product in the ligation reaction:
  * Transformation
      * I think this is working correctly-I get blue colonies, which suggests that the vector is getting transformed.
      * I've tried to optimize the amount of transformed cells on each plate:
          * 75uL SOC+cells (half the transformation product) gave what seemed like too few colonies
          * 175uL SOC+cells (all the transformation product) seemed too dense-colonies grew into each other
          * 125uL SOC+cells ???
  * Colony PCR
