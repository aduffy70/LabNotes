  * Lab meeting
      * Presented Prototype Assay data showing the opposite reaction to AFB treatment to what we hypothesized
          * Deepika Gaddam pointed out possible outliers. Verify they aren't affecting results.
          * Check the literature for other possible examples of GSTA activity decreasing with increased GSTA level.
          * Deepika will be running AFB trapping and immunoinhibition experiments which will more directly measure GSTA activity on AFB.
      * Roger Coulombe will be in Italy for most of June
      * Manuscript discussion:
          * Deepika will focus on getting more western blot, AFB trapping, and immunoinhibition data, since that is all relevant to this paper
          * I raised the question of how the CBC data fits into the story but didn't resolve anything
          * I need to start writing now. Deciding what data I want to present will determine what additional analysis is needed and which analyses need to be revisited/improved.
      * Sean has additional quail assay data to be analyzed.
