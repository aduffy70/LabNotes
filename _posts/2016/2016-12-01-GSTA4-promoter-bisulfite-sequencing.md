The Zymo OneStep kit worked on the top half of the GSTA4 promoter but not the bottom half. We need to bisulfite sequence the bottom half.
  * We have a set of primers we designed to cover 51 CpGs, 11 of which overlap with the top half. Two of those 11 are the type evaluated by the Zymo kit so we can make some comparison between the two methods.
  * Using the same EW1 and N1 bisulfite converted DNA from our GSTA3 bisulfite sequencing.

# Amplify bisulfite DNA using bisulfite primer pairs


# Analyze, purify, and quantify bisulfite PCR products


# Amplify genomic DNA using normal primer pairs

# Analyze, purify, and quantify normal PCR products

# Sequence bisulfite PCR products

# Sequence normal PCR products

# Compare bisulfite and normal sequences
