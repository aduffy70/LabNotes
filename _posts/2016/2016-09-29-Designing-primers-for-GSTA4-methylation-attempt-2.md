First set of primers we designed aren't working. Designing a new set with higher Tm values and longer sequences to minimize non-specific binding. Also avoiding sequence that has similar-looking sequence on Chromosome 1.

Designed 4 primers with Primer3 (with 26bp length and ~60C Tm) and ordered from IDT:
~~~
>G4_Promoter3-f
CTACCCTACGTTCTCCTACAAATGGA
>G4_Promoter3-r
AAAAGCGGAGTGAGAAAGAACGTTAA
>G4_Promoter4-f
ATCTCAGTGCTATTTCAGGTCTAAAC
>G4_Promoter4-r
AGTGTTAACAGAGCCATAGAATCATC
