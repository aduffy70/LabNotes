Comparing Velocity at 128uM AFB, Vmax, and Km values from AFBO trapping assays between three chicken types (Broiler, Fayoumi, and Leghorn) using One-way ANOVA.
  * There were no statistically significant differences--not surprising considering the small sample size (3 birds per type) and large variance within Types.
  * I provided the ANOVA output and boxplots of the Type means.
