# Retrogen sequencing order 2016-12-02

I want to know:
  1. For each CpG predicted in the genome, is it a CpG in the non-converted sequence for each sample?
  2. What additional CpGs are in the non-converted sequence for each sample

Process:
  * Use 1 and 2 to generate a master list of all CpG sites for each sample
  * For each CpG site on the master list, is the site a C, T, or Y (both) in the bisulfite converted sequence for each sample?
  * Record sites and methylation status in a table for comparison between samples
  * Identify differentially methylated sites and calculate methylation percentages (methylated sites/total sites) for each sample (how do we incorporate partially methylated sites into the calculation?)
