None of my known or suspected D. petersii samples from the GBS run are working when I try to amplify markers to identify my samples to species. I need to try extracting DNA from the plant tissue again to see if I can get DNA that I can amplify. Considered using Qiagen kits since we have a recently purchased one (from Martin Schilling) but even for the D. petersii sporophyte sample there isn't much green tissue.

Use the Soltis CTAB DNA Extraction Protocol. Exceptions/notes:

2016-04-06

  * Mixed fresh CTAB buffer (250 mL  batch)
      * Used Tris, NaCL, and EDTA solutions from 10/30/2012 (rechecked the pH of the Tris and NaCl. They are each off by about 0.5 but in opposite directions so I used them as is (Carol Rowe has fixed the pH meter since I made these so they may be exactly what they always were and my measurements were off when I made them.
      * Used CTAB from glass jar 042386
      * Used ddH2O from DNAse free stock 327390010 (because all of our ddH2O is over 3 years old)
      * All of these are the exact same reagents I used last time I made CTAB buffer.

  * Cleaned samples under a dissecting scope:
      * S53, 82-4-28-8, known D. petersii sporophyte
      * S50, 82-3-12-5, suspected D. petersii gametophyte
      * S21, 1172-b, suspected D. petersii gametophyte originally identified as T. intricatum
      * S26, 2002-1, suspected 4th species gametophyte originally identified as T. intricatum
  * Made 10mL CTAB buffer + PVP + B-merc
      * Used the fresh CTAB buffer from 4/6/16
      * Used PVP from Fisher 25 July 2008
      * Used B-merc from Sigma lot 110H0608
  * Ground using the Bernhardt lab bead beater (grinds much better and much faster than my previous drill-rig method):
      * 2mL tubes (not 1.5, you need the rounded bottom so the beads don't get stuck).
      * 2 glass beads per tube (Carol Rowe warns that if using metal beads, just use one or they will destroy the tube).
      * Shook dry tissue and beads for 5 minutes at 25Hz.
      * Added 500uL CTAB+PVP+B-merc and rocked by hand to get the ground up "gametophyte dust" from the walls of the tube into the buffer. Spun briefly intending to return everything to the bottom of the tube but even a short spin started creating a pellet from the dust. I want the tissue spread throughout the buffer so I rocked again by hand to re-disperse the pellet. I don't think I should spin at this step in the future.
  * Incubated at 55C in the Tropicooler heatblock from 11:00am until 8:30am 2016-04-13

2016-04-13

  * Used 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl from 11/19/13
  * After adding the 24:1 C:I, I mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Spun 20 minutes at 13000rpm in the Marathon microA centrifuge.
  * Aqueous layer + AmAcet. (from Der 10/06) + isoproponol (from green labeled ‘for extractions’ aliquot):
      * All samples had approximately the same volume and were pale yellow in color: 300uL, 24uL, 175uL
  * Mixed by hand shaking tubes for 5 minutes
  * Placed in -20 freezer at 9am

Continued at 2pm the same day:

  * Removed from freezer at 1:45pm
  * Used 70% EtOH from 2/20/08 AD
  * Used 95% EtOH from 4/20/04 JR
  * Resuspended in 50uL TE buffer from 10/31/12 overnight in the refrigerator

2016-04-19

  * Nanodropped at AGRS:
      * S21a - 6.0 ng/uL
      * S26a - 1.9 ng/uL
      * S50a - FAILED
      * S53a - 41.0 ng/uL
      * The gametophyte extractions have low yield but at least the sporophyte worked
      * Labeling all these with an 'a' suffix so they don't get confused with the previous extractions.
