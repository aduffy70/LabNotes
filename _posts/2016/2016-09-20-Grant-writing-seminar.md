# RGS Getting started as a successful proposal writer

One-day seminar offered by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies

Instructor: Peg AtKisson (Grant Writers' Seminars & Workshops, LLC)

My notes are in the seminar booklet, but general thoughts:

  * Schedule time for literature
  * Keep up on broader hot topics in Science and Nature
  * What is the problem/idea for my independent gametophyte research? Need to move from an 'activity' focus to a bigger picture view
  * To check out: [2010 user friendly handbook for project evaluation][1]
