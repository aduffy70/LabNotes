  * The lab inventory has numbered primers up to 258.
  * There is a book of primer sheets that are numbered up to 290.
  * Numbers 245-258 on the inventory do not match the sheets in the book so those numbers have likely been assigned twice.
  * I added space on the inventory for 259-290 and highlighted them with a note explaining that they have sheets, but haven't been recorded and that 245-258 have probably been assigned to 2 different primers.
  * I numbered my new primers starting at 291, added them to the inventory and put the sheets in the book.
  * I started a new box since I don't see boxes with primers beyond #262.
